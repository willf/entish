<p>This is a version of Dr. Will Fitzgerald's Dissertation, <em>Building Embedded

Conceptual Parsers</em>. The conversion was made semi-automatically, so there are

some errors that crept in, as it was converted from FrameMaker version 4.0 for the

Macintosh, to MIF format, to RTF format, to HTML. Chapter 3, for example, would  not 

convert from MIF at all. Oh well.</p>

<p>This dissertation describes how to build conceptual parsers (that is, natural

language understanding systems built on semantic and pragmatic principles) that

are embedded into application programs. A new architecture for building such

parsers, indexed concept parsing, is described. Indexed concept parsing is a

case-based reasoning approach to parsing, in which underlying target concepts

(that is, those conceptual representations of the application program

identified as important to recognize) are associated with sets of index

concepts. Each index concept is associated with sets of phrasal patterns. At

run time, the parser looks for phrasal patterns in input text, and the index

concepts recognized thereby are used to appraise the best matching target

concepts. The architecture defines a range of parsers, in which the complexity

of the index concept representations can vary according to the needs of the

application program: index concepts can be key words, synonym sets,

representations in an abstraction hierarchy, or representations in a partonomic

hierarchy. Indexed concept parsing was developed to build parsers for Casper,

an interactive learning environment designed to teach customer service

representatives how to solve customer problems, and TransAsk, a multimedia

system for transportation planners. Indexed concept parsing proved robust (for

example, the Casper parser had an accuracy rate ranging from 83-96%), yet

required minimal knowledge representation. A methodology for building an

indexed concept parser is given, and evaluation metrics are described. Another

parser, based on Direct Memory Access Parsing (DMAP), and developed for the

Creanimate biology tutor, is also described, as well as a DMAP parser for

Casper. Indexed concept parsing and DMAP are contrasted as architectures for

building embedded conceptual parsers. <p>

<p>Indexed Concept Parsing is demonstrated in a simple system for interacting
with customers, in a micro version of the 
<A HREF="http://techreport.ils.nwu.edu/tr51.html">Casper Project</A>.
This code was written in Macintosh Common Lisp, version 2.1, but should
be portable to other Lisps as well.<br><br>
