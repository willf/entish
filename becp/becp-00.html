<b><center>ABSTRACT</b><p>
<b></center><center></b>Building Embedded Conceptual Parsers<p>
</center><p>
<center>William Alan Fitzgerald<p>
</center><p>
This dissertation describes how to build conceptual parsers (that is, natural
language understanding systems built on semantic and pragmatic principles) that
are embedded into application programs. A new architecture for building such
parsers, indexed concept parsing, is described. Indexed concept parsing is a
case-based reasoning approach to parsing, in which underlying target concepts
(that is, those conceptual representations of the application program
identified as important to recognize) are associated with sets of index
concepts. Each index concept is associated with sets of phrasal patterns. At
run time, the parser looks for phrasal patterns in input text, and the index
concepts recognized thereby are used to appraise the best matching target
concepts. The architecture defines a range of parsers, in which the complexity
of the index concept representations can vary according to the needs of the
application program: index concepts can be key words, synonym sets,
representations in an abstraction hierarchy, or representations in a partonomic
hierarchy. Indexed concept parsing was developed to build parsers for Casper,
an interactive learning environment designed to teach customer service
representatives how to solve customer problems, and TransAsk, a multimedia
system for transportation planners. Indexed concept parsing proved robust (for
example, the Casper parser had an accuracy rate ranging from 83-96%), yet
required minimal knowledge representation. A methodology for building an
indexed concept parser is given, and evaluation metrics are described. Another
parser, based on Direct Memory Access Parsing (DMAP), and developed for the
Creanimate biology tutor, is also described, as well as a DMAP parser for
Casper. Indexed concept parsing and DMAP are contrasted as architectures for
building embedded conceptual parsers. <p>

<b><center>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b><p>
<b></center></b>Chris Riesbeck was the first member of the faculty I met at the
Institute for the Learning Sciences. He fascinated me with the idea of parsers
that could get bored if they had to, and then (patiently, over many months)
taught me why one might have to. He has modelled many things for me--elegant
programming style; how to do research in artificial intelligence and natural
language processing; how to write and act as a member of a community of
scholars. His advice, patience, example and humor have shaped my past few
years.<p>
Larry Birnbaum and Ken Forbus also served as members of my dissertation
committee. As others before me have said, I cannot underestimate the importance
of Larry's introduction to the ways of artificial intelligence research--how
hard, how intriguing, how much fun AI research can be. Ken works very hard, and
is very insightful--a combination before which I've often stood in awe. It was
an honor to have them on my committee.<p>
Roger Schank has gathered an astoundingly wonderful group of researchers at the
Institute for the Learning Sciences, and, through his vision for new ways of
educating, has provided many interesting opportunities for working on
intriguing projects. I am in his debt. I worked on building parsers that were
embedded in application programs, and I am indebted to the people who built
those application programs. Danny Edelson and Alex Kass were both graduate
students before me, and I profited from their advice and example, and am glad
for their friendship. Ray Bareiss encouraged and challenged me as I worked on
the challenge of adding a parser to a large-scale system. Other faculty and
staff at Northwestern have had their impact in ways too numerous to
mention--but I cannot fail to mention, by name at least, three others who were
my teachers: Gregg Collins, Paul Cooper, and Dedre Gentner.<p>
Grad school often provides a place for friendships to develop, and this was
true among those who took the qualifying exam the same year as I: Chip Cleary,
John Cleave, David Foster, John Hubbel, Steven McGee, Mike Sang, Nikitas
Sgouros, Eric Shafto, Ian Underwood, and Chris Wisdo. Chip has been a steady
friend and source of insights, suggestions and good coffee. Eric can convince
me of anything (even when we both know it's wrong). David,
conservative/rocker/professional volleyball player/AI hacker, is someone I
never have enough time to talk to. Chris has been a constant intellectual
sparring partner and colleague. Eric Goldstein always had an encouraging word
about my research.<p>
 Louise Pryor was a master at the mot juste, including wishing me the best of
British luck exactly when I needed it. Andy Fano helped me sharpen the
distinctions among different types of conceptual parsers. The members of the
Millard Fillmore Memorial (Film Noir) Lunch group patiently listened to my
ramblings even as I impatiently listened to theirs. Members of the
administrative and support staffs, including Elizabeth Brown, Amy Juhl, Teri
Lehmann, Heidi Levin, Sharon Lewis, Doug MacFarlane, Paul Ring, Michelle Suran
and Tina Turnbull made the Institute a (usually) efficient as well as an
(always) humane place to be. Heidi Levin also did the momentous favor of
proof-reading the technical report version of the dissertation. Friends outside
the Institute also need to be acknowledged, especially my fellow dissertator
Terry Wolfer; fellow household members Mark Knoper, Paul Tretbar, Bev Wiebe and
Dan Yutzy; and the members of the Elmwood Small Group and the JJSG at Reba
Place Church.<p>
It's impossible to acknowledge how important Bess Fitzgerald (my wife) has been
to my getting here. She has been constant in her support and love along the
way, never letting me quit or become overly discouraged. Our children, Mark
William Fitzgerald and Jane Elizabeth Fitzgerald, are just plain delightful and
a joy to come home to.<p>
