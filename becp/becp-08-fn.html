2.\tThe reason that some questions answered were not indexed was that they were
situational, for example, "What was your role during DSS?" asked of a
particular major. It would have been possible to index the paraphrase, "What
was Maj. Fulano de Tal's role during DSS?" This was not done strictly because
of constraints on time.<p>
3.\t"GTN" stands for "Global Transportation Network" and is an automation
system used by units to request transportation services.<p>
4.\tThe index concept editor described in the following text relies heavily on
interface code written by Chris Wisdo, Richard Lynch, and Michael Engber.<p>
5.\tThe M- prefix stands for MOP (Memory Organization Package). See Schank
(1982).<p>
6.\tThis also implies that there is a good deal of semantic similarity among
target concepts. This would not be true if each target concept tended to be
very different semantically from the other target concepts.<p>
7.\tMore accurately, we need to retrieve target concepts when they carry an
abstraction of an index concept referenced in the input text. See Chapter 4.<p>
8.\tMore accurately, in the number of index concept sets created for target
concepts; because this will be linear to the number of target concepts (at most
a small multiple), we will talk in terms of the number of target concepts.
