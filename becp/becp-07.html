<center><b>How to Build an Embedded Conceptual Parser Using Indexed Concept
Parsing</b><p>
<b></center></b><p>
<p>
In the previous two chapters, we described the development of indexed concept
parsing in the context of the Casper customer service representative tutor. In
this chapter, we describe the steps required for creating an indexed concept
parser for application programs in general. Essentially, there are five major
tasks in creating an index concept parser:<p>
Gather background information,<p>
Choose matching and appraiser functions,<p>
Design the interface,<p>
Create indices,<p>
Evaluate and refine the parser.<p>
We will examine each of these general tasks in turn. After describing the
tasks, we describe the functional roles involved in carrying out these tasks
(the roles of programmer, content specialist and interface designer), and how
the tasks are ordered.<p>
<b>Gather background information</b><p>
<b></b>To build an embedded conceptual parser, we first need to gather
background information about the application program, specifically its
conceptual memory and ways its interface will affect the parsing task. Having
gathered information about the application program, one needs to:<p>
Identify the target concepts within the conceptual memory, <p>
Identify the architecture of conceptual memory, and<p>
Identify contextual supports provided by the application program.<p>
We describe each of these in turn.<p>
<b>Identify the target concepts</b><p>
<b></b>We will need to know what are the target concepts of that memory. That
is, we need to identify what specific conceptual representations are important
to recognize. In Casper, these were the statements a customer service
representative might make. <p>
<b>Identify the architecture of conceptual memory</b><p>
<b></b>We need to know the structure of the conceptual memory used by the
application program because this affects the way we identify and construct both
index and target concepts. Conceptual memories are typically structured as
taxonomies and partonomies. In a taxonomy, concepts in memory are related to
one another in an abstraction hierarchy (isa hierarchy). In a partonomy, a
concept is related to another concept if the first is the value of some
attribute (that is, is a part of) some other concept.<p>
It is not always the case that the conceptual memory will have taxonomic or
partonomic structure. In the applications we have seen, Creanimate's conceptual
memory was organized into several taxonomies with partonomic structure. The
concepts in Casper, on the other hand, were neither organized into taxonomies
or partonomies. However, if the conceptual memory is organized taxonomically or
partonomically, we may be able to use this structure in building or identifying
index concepts (this is described in greater detail in Section  7.4). <p>
Ideally, the index concepts will be defined in the same language as the target
concepts. In order to create index concepts and use them in parsing, we need to
know:<p>
how to define a concept,<p>
how to define an abstraction relationship between two concepts,<p>
how to define a partonomic (attribute/value) relationship between two
concepts,<p>
how to determine whether one concept is an abstraction or specialization of
another concept,<p>
how to determine all of the abstractions of a concept, and<p>
how to determine the value of an attribute of a concept.

the indexed concept parser is to take advantage of abstraction relationships
among index concepts, then the abstraction creation and access functions must
be available. If the indexed concept parser is to take advantage of partonomic
relationships among index concepts and target concepts, then the partonomic
creation and access functions must be available. Table  7.1 shows typical Lisp
forms for defining these functions. The forms used are consistent with the
frame system code found in the Appendix<a name="fnB0" href="#fn0">[1]</a>. It
is possible that the conceptual memory does not have these functions already
defined, because they are not needed for the application program's processing
of target concepts. As these functions are required for creating and accessing
indexed concepts, however, they will need to be built.<p>
<b>Identify contextual clues provided by the application program</b><p>
<b></b>As someone uses an application program, typically the situation he or
she is in will affect the task of the parser, providing contextual clues to
constrain or support the task of parsing. These clues can come from any number
of different sources, but they will primarily affect how we process target
concepts and build phrasal patterns. Two types of contextual clues are
expectations on target concepts, and clues about acceptable phrasal patterns.<p>
Expectations on target concepts. The most common (and perhaps most useful)
contextual clue will be expectations on target concepts. Typically, in a
particular situation, only certain target concepts will produce meaningful
responses from the application program. Informing the parser about which target
concepts are to be expected in a particular situation can increase the parser's
precision. This can be done by creating an appraiser (See Section  7.2.3) based
on these expectations. <p>
Clues for phrasal patterns. Often, the interface of the application program
will suggest to the user certain phrasal patterns the parser needs to
recognize. This can happen in a number of ways. For example, in the Creanimate
program, the prompted templates set expectations for the linguistic forms a
student could type. Similarly, in the initial version of the Casper parser, the
text of the templates was used as part of the phrasal patterns attached to
target concepts. <p>
In addition to the text that appears in templates, text and graphics elsewhere
in the application interface can affect the phrasal patterns required. For
example, in the Casper tutor, students were provided with a "water map" that
showed how the water company processed and delivered water to customers (See
Figure  7.1). The primary goal of the water map was to act as a pedagogical aid
to students as they developed internal models of solving problems about water
quality. But the pictures and text on the water map also affect what the parser
must recognize. For example, a British equivalent of "fire fighters" is "the
fire brigade," and so they are described on the water map. But even North
American users of Casper were likely to use "fire brigade" to refer to fire
fighters, because this expression appears on the water map. Therefore, "fire
brigade" was a phrasal pattern that needed to be added to the index concept for
fire fighters, even for a North American audience.

It is always useful for a designer of an embedded program to understand the
application into which it will be embedded. For building an indexed concept
parser, there is a special need to understand the conceptual memory underlying
the application program, and how the interactions which a user has with the
application program will affect parsing.<p>
<b>Choose matching and appraiser functions</b><p>
<b></b>Having investigated the conceptual representations the application
expects and affords, one should have a good foundation for the next stages in
creating an indexed concept parser. The central task will be to index the
target concepts. But before indexing begins, it is important to select
matching, text transducing and appraising functions. <p>
<b>Choose a matching function</b><p>
<b></b>When an indexed concept parser processes text, it proceeds in two
stages. First, the parser looks for references to index concepts in the input
text. Then, the set of index concepts found is matched against target concepts
in memory. How the parser finds references to index concepts in the input text
can vary; the two matchers we have described in previous chapters rely on
either a simple search technique, or Direct Memory Access Parsing.<p>
A simple search technique may be enough for finding references to index
concepts in input text. For example, the following Common Lisp function will
determine whether a phrasal pattern can be found in an input text:<p>
<tt>(defun phrase-match-p (phrasal-pattern words)</tt><p>
<tt>  (search phrasal-pattern words))</tt><p>
<tt></tt>This assumes the input text has been converted into symbols (see the
next section on text transducing functions), and that phrasal patterns are
defined as lists of symbols.<p>
Finding references to index concepts in the input text can also be done using
Direct Memory Access Parsing. DMAP can collect references to index concepts and
pass them on to the next stage of indexed concept parsing. A DMAP-style parser
is required if the phrasal patterns to index concepts are structured (that is,
have references to the partonomic or taxonomic structure of an index concept).
Although a DMAP-style parser is required for recognizing index concepts via
structured phrasal patterns, DMAP-style parsers will work in the simpler case
as well, when the phrasal patterns do not have structure.<p>
<b>Choose text transducing functions</b><p>
<b></b>Often, the input text will need to be converted into another form before
the parsing techniques can be used. This may be simply converting input strings
into symbolic form. It may mean using stemming techniques to supply the parser
with root forms of words, rather than the words themselves. Before adding
phrasal patterns to index concepts, it is important to understand exactly what
requirements there will be on the patterns. If the parser is built to look for
symbolic roots as phrasal patterns, then the text needs to be converted into a
list of symbolic roots.<p>
<b>Choose appraisal functions</b><p>
<b></b>In the first stage of indexed concept parsing, the matcher collects
references to index concepts in the input text. In the second stage, these
index concepts are matched against the index concepts associated with target
concepts. The goodness of match is calculated with user-defined appraisal
functions, as described in Chapter 5. In the previous chapters, we described
four criteria with which to judge the match between an input text and a target
concept:<p>
Index concepts predicted. How many of the index concepts associated with the
target concept were seen in the input text?<p>
Index concepts unpredicted. How many of the index concepts seen in the input
text were not associated with the target concept?<p>
Index concepts unseen. How many of the index concepts associated with the
target concept were seen in the input text?<p>
Expectations. Was this target concept expected in the current situation?<p>
 In calculating the match score between an input text and a target concept,
points are added for the index concepts predicted, and points are subtracted
for index concepts unpredicted and index concepts unseen. How many points are
added or subtracted needs to be specified to the index concept parser. Some
different possibilities are:<p>
Add one point for each index concept seen, and subtract one point for each
index concept unpredicted or unseen.<p>
Add one point for each index concept seen, and ignore unpredicted or unseen
index concepts.<p>
Add the information value<a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[2]</a> for each index
concept seen, and subtract the information value for each unpredicted or unseen
index concept.<p>
Which possibility to choose will depend on characteristics of the
representations used and what type of statements the users of the application
will create. The last scoring method, the default given in the appendix, has
the characteristics:<p>
In providing positive evidence (index concepts seen), index concepts with high
information value provide exponentially more weight than index concepts with
low information value, and<p>
Negative evidence (index concepts not seen or not predicted) is considered, but
only to the extent of the information value of the index concepts involved.<p>
Because of the weighting mechanism described in the next section, each of the
appraisal functions must return a value between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. In the
Appendix, appraisal functions that calculate matches based on index concepts
seen, index concepts not seen, and index concepts not predicted are given. As
we saw in Chapter 6, however, an appraisal function based on expectations for
target concepts can greatly improve the recall and precision of an indexed
concept parser. <p>
<b>Set the weights for the appraisal functions</b><p>
<b></b>The four appraisal functions described in the previous section can be
weighted to bias the matching towards one or more of the criteria. This is done
through a voting mechanism: Each criterion defined is assigned one or more
votes. Two common strategies are:<p>
Bias the parser towards target concepts that are expected.<p>
Bias the parser towards positive evidence.<p>
An example setting to execute these strategies would be giving the expectation
criterion five votes, the index concepts predicted criterion three votes, and
the other criteria one vote each. This provides a strong bias towards expected
target concepts and a weaker bias towards the positive evidence of index
concepts seen<a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[3]</a>.<p>
<b>Design the parser interface </b><p>
<b></b>Another step is the design of the human-computer interface to the
embedded parser. A typical interaction with an embedded indexed concept parser
in an interactive parser will have the following steps:<p>
The user enters text into a type-in box.<p>
The user presses a "Parse this" button (which may, of course, say something
else, or be activated when the Return or Enter key is pressed).<p>
The indexed concept parser parses the input, and presents the best matches to
the user.<p>
The user commits to one of the best matches, or returns to step 1. <p>
The specifics of the "look and feel" of the interface will depend on a number
of requirements, and it is beyond the scope of this dissertation to discuss all
of these. However, certain design choices will impinge on the parsing, and
these will be of particular concern. These choices include the use of template
screens and the acceptable set size.<p>
<b>Template Screens</b><p>
<b></b>In previous chapters, we described the use of templates and template
screens. Templates are prompted, fill-in-the-blank interface items that suggest
to the user the types of input that will be parsable. In Chapter 4, we
described a complicated template screen mechanism that did not work very well,
and it was our desire to move away from prompted templates that suggested the
technique of indexed concept parsing. However, if it is possible to create
template screens, they can affect parsing positively, by providing clues to the
user as to what is expected. The text of the prompts and that syntactic
requirements of what is to be entered into the blank will affect the phrasal
patterns that are defined for index concepts. It may even suggest (as in the
Creanimate case) that more direct parsing methods, such as DMAP, can be used.<p>
<b>Choose the acceptable set size</b><p>
<b></b>The acceptable set size is the number of best-matched target concepts
which the indexed concept parser should return. In the Casper parser, the
acceptable set size was seven. The best match was given as the default response
for the user to select, and additional target concepts were selectable from a
separate user menu.<p>
If the acceptable set size is one--that is, the parser should return only the
best match--one should be aware that there is likely to be a significantly
larger number of parsing failures. In the analyses of the Casper parser given
in the previous chapter, there are 10 to 20% differences between perfect and
acceptable recall rates.<p>
<b>Index the target concepts</b><p>
<b></b>Indexing the target concepts of an application program means building
representations for index concepts and phrasal patterns. The basic methodology
is this:<p>
For each target concept, identify sets of index concepts.<p>
For each index concept, identify phrasal patterns.<p>
<b>Index each target concept with sets of index concepts</b><p>
<b></b>To be found in the matching phase, each target concept must have
associated with it at least one set of index concepts. It may be helpful to
think of each set of index concepts applying to a paraphrase of the target
concept. For example, in the Casper tutor, in which customer service
representative statements were the target concepts, the following target
concept:<p>
ASK-NEIGHBOURS-AFFECTED Are your neighbours also affected? <p>
has the following set of index concepts attached to it:<p>
{NEIGHBOURS AFFECTED}<p>
But the following set of index concepts is also attached to this target
concept:<p>
{NEIGHBOURS EXPERIENCE SIMILAR PROBLEM}<p>
This set of index concepts was created to recognize input statements of the
type, "Are your neighbours experiencing similar problems?" which is a
paraphrase for "Are your neighbours affected?" seen in student inputs. <p>
<b>Index each index concept with phrasal patterns</b><p>
<b></b>Each index concept needs at least one phrasal pattern attached to it, or
it will not be recognized. Multiple phrasal patterns can be associated with
each index concept. We have described three different types of phrasal patterns
in this work, each a linearly ordered set:<p>
sets of words,<p>
sets of word roots,<p>
sets of word roots in combination with structural references.<p>
As we described in Section  7.2, what the phrasal patterns consist of will
depend on the matching function we use in the first stage of indexed concept
parsing as well as the text transducing functions we apply to the input text.<p>
<b>Evaluate and refine the parser</b><p>
Having created an indexed concept parser for an application using the steps
described previously, the next step is to evaluate it. Of course, we have
described doing indexing in an iterative manner, so some of this evaluation can
take place as the indexing occurs. But in the end, the parser needs to be
evaluated using a real target population. How this evaluation takes place will
vary from project to project, but evaluation principles are described in
Chapter 2 of this dissertation, and descriptions of specific evaluation methods
used are described in the chapters on the Creanimate and Casper parsers.<p>
<b>Who does what, when?</b><p>
<b></b>Building an indexed concept parser requires three basic function
roles--a programmer, a content specialist (knowledge engineer), and an
interface designer. Of course, combinations of these roles can be carried out
by the same person; for example, the programmer may act as the content
specialist as well. The programmer has overall responsibility for creating the
software that implements the indexed concept parser. The content specialist is
especially responsible for creating index concepts and phrasal patterns. The
interface designer is responsible for designing the parser's human-computer
interface. Figure  7.2 lays out in detail the responsibilities of these roles.
This figure also shows the dependencies among the tasks described in this
chapter, and therefore show how the steps are to be sequenced.<p>
<b>Summary</b><p>
<b></b>This chapter has described the various tasks involved in creating an
indexed concept parser. After gathering background information about the
application (especially identify the target concepts and architecture of the
conceptual memory), the specific parameters of the parser are defined
(especially deciding on a matching function and appraisers). Then, the target
concepts are indexed, and phrasal patterns assigned to index concepts. Finally,
the parser is tested and refined.<p>
In the next chapter, we exemplify this methodology by describing how an indexed
concept parser was added to the TransAsk military logistics advisor.<p>
<a name="fn0" href="#fnB0">[1.]</a>With the exception that the version of
DEF-FRAME in the Appendix defines concepts, abstraction relationships and
attribute/value relationships with one form.<p>
<a name="fn1" href="#fnB1">[2.]</a>As stated in Chapter 5, the information
value of an index concept is , where r is the number of times the index concept
is assigned to target concepts, and n is the number of index concepts.<p>
<a name="fn2" href="#fnB2">[3.]</a>Note that by the algorithm given for
indexed concept parsing in Chapter 5, a target concept is not scored unless at
least one index concept associated with the concept is seen in the input. This
means that the bias towards expected target concepts does not come into play
unless one of its associated indexed concepts is seen.
