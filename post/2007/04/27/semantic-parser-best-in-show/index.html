<p>I got an email today from <a href="http://compbio.uchsc.edu/Hunter/">Larry Hunter</a> at University of Colorado School of Medicine, who writes to say that a DMAP-based parser was the “international world-champion” in the The <a href="http://biocreative.sourceforge.net/">BioCreAtIvE</a> (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology) data text mining challenge. The chart above are the results from the <a href="http://biocreative.sourceforge.net/biocreative_2_ppi.html">Protein-Protein Interaction Task</a>.</p>
<p>My colleague at Powerset, Jim Firby and I worked on some of the semantic parsing technology used by the Colorado group. Members of the <a href="http://compbio.uchsc.edu/ccp/bionlp/index.shtml">Center for Computational Pharmacology Biomedical Text Mining Group</a> were the direct researchers on this project though. Congratulations, Larry and team!</p>
