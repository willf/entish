Jane revealed the ‘psalm, hymn or spiritual song’ she’s been keeping secret: O Come, O Come Imannuel. I began a series on the Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective; the first article is on God (<a href="http://www.entish.org/essays/on_God.html">I spoke in favor</a>). Bess made chili and bean soup for afterwards; one participant, Carolyn, brought her own can of soup just in case the soup being served contained beans, which was wonderfully prescient of her. We learned that our dear Barb, who has been a member at Pine Grove Mennonite for over fifty years (KMF will be only her second church, a steadiness I admire) used to dress plainly (only a couple of women continue to wear head coverings at Pine Grove now).</p>
