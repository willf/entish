But he also wrote a song called “The Future Soon.” It it, the protagonist sings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week I left a note on Laura’s desk It said I love you signed anonymous friend Turns out she’s smarter than I thought she was She knows I wrote it, now the whole class does too … But I know that I’ll forget the look of pity in her face When I’m living in my solar dome on a platform in space.
Ok; this is garden variety young geek fantasy; perhaps even socially and emotionally useful, in that it might propel him to greater things:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll probably be some kind of scientist Building inventions in my space lab in space I’ll end world hunger I’ll make dolphins speak
But then the fantasy turns, and he’s training a ‘warrior robot race’ and becoming a cyborg himself. And regarding Laura:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll see her standing by the monorail She’ll look the same except for bionic eyes She lost the real ones in the robot wars I’ll say I’m sorry, she’ll say it’s not your fault Or is it? And she eyes me suspiciously Hearing the whir of the servos inside She will scream and try to run But there’s nowhere she can hide When a crazy cyborg wants to make you his robot bride
This is “beyond creepy,” as a friend wrote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess I just want to go on record to say that, as much as I music by and about my fellow geeks in general, and Coulton in particular, this song is “beyond creepy” in its male misogynist revenge fantasy. In many ways, [male] geeks really are taking over power, and you know, like geek hero Spiderman says, with great power comes great responsibility. The least we can do (and it is not very much) is to disavow rape fantasy songs.</p>
