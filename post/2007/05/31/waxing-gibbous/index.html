<p>When there’s a second full moon of a calendar month, it’s come to be called a Blue Moon.
I like the careful use of “it’s come to be called,” since it is a bit controversial what “blue moon” means, and where it comes from. But I think they’re right that “the second full moon of a calendar month” is the most common meaning of “blue moon” these days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They point out that not everyone in the world has two full moons in the same calendar month: Europe, for instance, has two full moon <em>next</em> month, because the full moon comes after midnight local times.</p>
<p>Oddly, the good people at Earth and Sky say, “Earth is divided into about 24 separate time zones.” There are actually about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zones">39 time zones</a>, with fractional time zones scattered here and there: Newfoundland, for example, is offset -3 hr 30 minutes from universal time, India Standard Time is +5:30, and Nepal is +5:45.</p>
<p>I think everyone should be subscribed to <a href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.time.tz/">the world’s most boring mailing list</a>.</p>
