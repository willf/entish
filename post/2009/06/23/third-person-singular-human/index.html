<p>(1) Everyone should do <em>his</em> own work.</p>
<p>There are at least six common solutions proposed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <em>he or she</em> (or <em>she or he</em>). (<em>Everyone should do his or her own work.</em>) This includes everyone, but at the cost of more words.</li>
<li>Use impersonal <em>they</em>. (<em>Everyone should do their own work.</em>). This includes everyone, and there is ample practice (both contemporary and historic) to support its use, but the plural sense is still somewhat salient.</li>
<li>Use <em>she</em>. (<em>Everyone should do her own work.</em>) This “makes it fairer” by compensating for past male pronoun use, but the femaleness is even more salient (the ‘female’ tending to be more marked than the ‘male’–and, of course, some will say this is the point). I see this frequently in philosophical writing, sometimes combined with a strategy for alternating between ‘he’ and ‘she.’</li>
<li>Use a newly invented term, such as <em>e</em> and <em>ir</em>. (<em>Everyone should do ir own work.</em>) This potentially solves the problem, but has never caught on; nor do I suspect it will.</li>
<li>Assert forcefully that ‘he’ includes ‘she’ and deny there is a problem. (<em>Everyone should do his own work.</em>) This is just wishful thinking.</li>
<li>Rewrite to remove the generic construction. (<em>Our motto should be: Do your own work!</em> or <em>You should do your own work.</em>) This is nothing wrong with this solution; it takes more effort, though, and sometimes the result is awkward. (<em>Work must be done only by the person who is responsible for said work.__—Is that awkward enough to prove my point?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I had the mad idea last night of another solution: Start using <em>he/him/his</em> to only refer to the generic third person, and invent a new series of pronouns for male references (for example, <em>e/im/is</em>). At one grammatical swoop, we fix all the generic third person problems, and force saliency on the marked gender case (<em>Everyone should do his own work.</em>/<em>Each girl should do her own work.</em>/<em>Each boy should do is own work.</em>). This solution is no more likely to achieve consensus than (4) above. But just in case the English Academy dictates this use, I want credit for inventing the Fitzgerald pronoun.</p>
