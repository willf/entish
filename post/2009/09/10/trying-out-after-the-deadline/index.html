<blockquote>
<p>I <em>knew</em> someone what couldnt spell and who’s weblogs <em>shysters avoided assiduously.</em>
Things it got right:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>“new” for “knew,” even though “new” is properly spelled</li>
<li>found a passive (though passives aren’t bad, of course; dull writing is bad)</li>
<li>found a cliche, “like the plague” (which I hand-edited to “assiduously”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Things it missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>informal “what” introducing a dependent clause (not a real problem for me)</li>
<li>misspelled “couldnt” for “couldn’t”</li>
<li>misspelled “who’s” for “whose”</li>
<li>improperly suggested that “shysters” was misspelled</li>
<li>did not flag “<a href="http://willwhim.wordpress.com/2007/05/01/the-shyster-saga/">shyster</a>” as biased language</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, it could be a useful tool if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->utilized correct<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->used correctly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> you use it well.</p>
<p>(Note: you have to turn on proofreading options under your profile. You can decide to uncheck the passive voice nagger, for example).</p>
<p>(Second note: you’ll have to guess what AtD thought “nagger” was the misspelling of.)</p>
