      <title>What do you need to know to program FizzBuzz?</title>

      <description>I was showing my CS professor friend the hilarious “FizzBuzz in TensorFlow” post, and he’d actually had not heard of FizzBuzz. Basically FizzBuzz is a test to see if someone can do basic programming.
This got me to thinking about what you actually need to know about a particular programming language and software engineering to program FizzBuzz in.
Here’s a basic implementation in Go:
So I think these are the things you need to know (including the syntax of these in a particular language):</description>

      <description>Of Truth
Francis Bacon, translated by Will Fitzgerald August 1, 2015
“What is truth?” asked jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Certainly there have been those who delight in giddiness, and count it bondage to settle on a belief, who affect free will in thinking as well as in acting. And though the schools of philosophers of that kind are gone, there remain certain chattering wits of the same vein—though not with as much blood in them as there was in the ancients.</description>

      <description>To partially update an Elasticsearch document in 1.6, you’ll need to create a script for the partial update, and potentially use an upsert.
For example, you want to add tags to a blog post
here’s an example of a document created directly:
POST /website/blog/1/_update { “doc” : { “tags” : [ “testing” ], “views”: 0 } }
but if we want to add a tag without changing the view, you need to create a script in config/scripts</description>

      <title>Word vectors: Machine learning oversimplified</title>

      <description>Word vectors have become increasingly important in as features in machine learning models for natural language processing. The idea is to represent a word in some multidimensional space (the vector) in which words which are “similar” are similar in that space. Typically, one hopes that word vectors will provide some kind of semantic similarity. A typical party trick is to use word vectors to solve word analogy problems; e.g., king is to queen as man is to ?</description>

      <description>What is Named Entity Recognition? Named Entity Recognition (or NER) is the task of finding all the names of things in a text. For example, in the sentence “Jimi Hendrix played ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at Woodstock,” NER, correctly done, would find the references to “Jimi Hendrix,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and “Woodstock.” Note that NER should also extract names it has never previously seen; for example, in the sentence “Johannes von Smetly is the protagonist in Willard Smith’s new novel”, an NER system should extract “Johannes von Smetly” as a name, even if it it doesn’t appear in any standard name list.</description>

      <description>What is part of speech tagging? Part of speech tagging (POS tagging) is a classification problem: assigning each word or token in a text to a “part of speech,” that is, a lexical/grammatical class for each token. Different theories, or (perhaps more importantly) different uses will suggest different sets of grammatical labels, but they typically include nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. For example, the sentence “John thinks it’s all good.” might be tagged as:</description>

      <description>What is sentiment analysis?
Many texts contain an opinion about something: say, a movie or product review, a description of the service at a restaurant, a political position or candidate, or how things are going at a company. Sentiment analysis attempts to classify those opinions: did the writer have a positive opinion? A negative one? Or are they neutral? Sentiment analysis might also suggest how positive or negative an opinion is.</description>

      <description>This interesting article on using Google Ngram data to estimate when new names for world cities overtook their names (for example, “Beijing” instead of “Peking”) makes the following claim:
 “Istanbul” is still less commonthan “Constantinople” more than five hundred years after the the city fell to the Muslims.But I think this is either a bit tongue-in-cheek, or misinformed. Of course, the Ngram data records books discussing any period of history, and I suspect that more is written about historic Constantinople than modern Istanbul.</description>

      <description>I was writing some Scala code which had a long series of somewhat complicated and expensive calculations to make, and in many cases I wanted to log the intermediate calculations. The first version of this code was quite complicated looking, because the calculations of the intermediate values and the logging statements were all intermixed.
But then I realized that I could create a separate object which maintained the state, and which performed the calculations, too.</description>

In it, he does something I haven’t seen anyone else do, which is to dive into his own data looking for indicators of success of people he has hired. He found that referral quality and school quality were the two most predictive indicators. Lukas does not break down his data by gender or age or other demographic classes.</description>

      <description>There is a controversy over “Computational linguistics and literary scholarship.” A paper published at the Association for Computational Linguistics David Bamman, Brendan O’Connor, &amp;amp; Noah A. Smith, “Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters“) has come under criticims by Hannah Alpert-Abrams with Dan Garrette, “Some thoughts on the relationship between computational linguistics and literary scholarship“. The primary criticism has been that the ACL paper fails to cite any literary scholarship past the middle of the last century.</description>

      <description>Well, I didn’t think I’d write another Fibonacci A Day post — but there’s a great fibonacci function that’s defined right in the Scala documents, in their discussion of Streams.
A stream is a standard Scala data structure which is very list like. Recall that a Scala list has two parts, a head and a tail; the head is a value, and the tail is either the special empty list (Nil), or another list.</description>

      <description>I am taking Martin Odensky’s Functional Programming in Scala class, and discovered (or rediscovered) that the Fibonacci function is discussed in SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, the book that Odensky seems to be basing much of his Functional Programming in Scala course on).
Even more interesting is that a Fibonacci function which runs in O(lg(n)) steps is presented — that is, it takes about lg(n) steps to compute the _n_th Fibonacci number, instead of n steps.</description>

      <description>The goal of this series was to come up with a general, efficient fibonacci function that goes beyond the typical computer science introduction. The version we developed is fast, efficient with respect to memory, and general. I’d be glad to hear comments.

      <description>We are now confident that the fast recursive version is the best of the algorithms we have explored — it is fast, and can handle large values of the Fibonacci function.
I haven’t been happy, though, with returning a negative -1 when the function is called with a negative number — this feels like a kind of silent error we were trying to avoid in going to BigInts. Fortunately, it turns out that there is a natural extension of the Fibonacci sequence to negative numbers.</description>

      <description>The following table describes the limits of the various Fibonacci algorithms I’ve created during this series. I ran them through a very simple benchmarking routine, and empirically tested them for the maximum size they can handle. Each benchmark was run 1000 times, except the first algorithm, which was run just once — we already know it runs too slow. These were run on a MacBook Air (Late 2010).

      <description>Although the iterative recursive version is stateless, it looks different from the standard mathematical definition. The recursive version is a very close mapping, but it’s extremely inefficient. One way to overcome the inefficiencies is to dynamically record (or memoize) previous calculations of F(n). The idea is simple — if we already know the values of F(n – 1) and F(n – 2), we can simply add them without having to do the difficult steps in recreating them.</description>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence has a very strong connection to the Golden Ratio (φ, or Phi). φ is defined as (√5 + 1)/2, or approximately 1.618, and has lots of special properties. Ron Knott has a web page with over 300 Fibonacci and φ formulas. One of these is this direct formula: F(n) = round(φn/√5), where the rounding function does rounding to the nearest whole number.
This gives us a quite an efficient function:</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/2013/03/18/a-fibonacci-a-day-speedy-recursion/</guid>
      <description>We have seen a very inefficient recursive version of the Fibonacci function, and an efficient iterative version. Is there an efficient recursive version?
Yes, in fact. Recall that the definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:
F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
What’s important to note is that the recursive step of the Fibonacci formula has two values that need to be accumulated. In the iterative version, the two temporary variables u and v are used to accumulate these values.</description>

      <description>Yesterday’s iterative version of the Fibonacci function is pretty speedy, especially compared to the recursive version. It calculates F(1000) in almost no time at all —
But. The result for F(1000) looks suspiciously low — and odd things happen if we use a different ‘high’ number, such as 100:
As it turns out, Scala’s Int and Long types are always signed, and do silent overflow. Once the number gets to a certain size, adding more will turn it ‘negative,’ and adding even more will eventually turn it positive, but (of course) the number is not correct.</description>

      <description>Yesterday’s Fibonacci function was recursive, but we saw that it was extremely inefficient. Recursive functions typically break down a problem into smaller pieces, solve the smaller pieces, then combine the results into a final result, where “breaking down” a problem is done by the recursive function calling itself on a smaller version of itself. But, as we saw, it’s possible that the number of times this may happen has to be controlled, or gross inefficiencies may occur; this sometimes gives recursion a bad name.</description>

      <description>Binging for “Fibonacci” and “Pi,” I came across this page: Pi and the Fibonacci Numbers, which has the nice formula
pi/4 = Σk=1arccot(F(2k+1)) summed to ∞, where F(n) is the _n_th Fibonacci number.
So, if you can compute the Fibonacci sequence, you can compute pi.</description>

      <description>The definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:
F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
This naturally leads to the following recursive function (here, as in all of the versions of A Fibonacci A Day, in Scala):
Note that because we are in the world of Scala, we have to declare that we are writing a function on Ints (that is, the Java/Scala representation of 32-bit signed numbers).</description>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers 0,1,1,2,3,5,8, … such that the nth number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers; and the the first two numbers are defined to be 0 and 1.
The Fibonacci function is a function which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. It’s kind of a famous function in computer science when people are first learning about recursive functions.</description>

      <description>Debasish Ghosh wrote an interesting post, An exercise in Refactoring – Playing around with Monoids and Endomorphisms, in which he describes refactoring some imperative code and writing it in a more functional style. I especially like his clear description on what monoids and endomorphisms are. I suspect the main point of his article is to describe these things, and how them might be useful, and I think he succeeds, at least in the first part.</description>

      <description>It would be nice to have an IDE while writing Scalding code, to do syntax checking and method suggestion. I was able to get sbt, Scalding, and IntelliJ to work reasonably nicely together. Here are some notes on this, so you can too.
Build file Add the following to your sbt build file (of course, you may want to add additional dependencies or initial commands):
Plugins You’ll also want to use the excellent sbt- plugin, so add this to projects/plugins.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since I thought about Paul Graham’s essay, Revenge of the Nerds, in which he highlighted the advantages Lisp has over other programming languages, or the essay Eric Kidd wrote, Why Ruby is an acceptable LISP, in which he highlighted features of the Ruby language that made it “acceptable” to use as a Lisp replacement.
Wordnik made the transition from Java to Scala before I joined them, and at least in my early days there, it seemed like the question was “Why Scala is a better Java.</description>

      <title>Where did the “bon pour Nicole” folk etymology of “pumpernickel” come from?</title>

      <description>The origin of pumpernickel is relatively clear — the first part, at least, derives from the onomatopoeic German word Pumpf, or fart (Anatoly Lieberman has an interesting column connecting to pimp, and pimp to the history of faggot).
But there is a folk etymology that tells this story: when Napoleon was marching through Westphalia, he was given some of their rough, dark bread, and he said it was only “bon pour Nicole” — good for Nicole, his horse.</description>

      <description>Slate has a review of a new book with the obscure title 10 PRINT CHR$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO 10, and this brings back such memories of typing in games from Basic Computer Games. The Basic program above prints (forever) as seen in this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo.
The magic here is that the computer is printing either a left or a right angled line character over and over; this looks like a maze.</description>

      <description>I am glad that Natalia Cecire has published a commentary — The passion of Nate Silver (sort of) — on the recent attacks and counter-attacks on Nate Silver’s predictions for the upcoming presidential debate on his New York Times hosted blog, FiveThirtyEight. Silver was described by MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough as an “ideologue” and a “joke” who is biased in favor of Obama; and Silver’s defenders have accused his attackers as, among other things, “innumerate” and “braying idiot detractors.</description>

I’ll still be working for Wordnik — thank God and Tony Tam — but mostly working remotely. I’ll be coming to California once a month, as I have done in the past prior to working for Wordnik.

      <description>I’ve been working with the Dispatch library for Scala over the past couple of days. This is a library for “library for asynchronous HTTP interaction,” and it’s a wrapper for a similar library in Java. It’s been a little tricky to learn — the documentation could be better — and it seems useful to take down a few notes. First, though, it’s worth noting that you need to understand both the 0.</description>

 First of all, from what I understand from doctors [pregnancy from rape] is really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work, or something.</description>

      <description>I was wondering whether Scala had a parallel map function built in — it didn’t seem like it did.
Edit: But it does; see Erik Post’s comment below.
But, if you have a sequence of functions, for example:
val fns = List(() =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;goodbye&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;good to see you&amp;quot;)
You can create a sequence of futures on it (thus, running them in parallel): import scala.actors.Futures._ val futures = fns.</description>

      <description>The tr program converts a string of characters into another string of characters, using a very simple rule system. The tr [A-Z] [a-z]. But this works for simple “ASCII” strings only. tr, at least on many systems, understands Unicode, and so the standard example fails for converting, say, Russian or Czech. But tr also understands character classes, so the standard example should be written tr [:upper:] [:lower:].

I’m afraid that This American Life’s focus on its own errors might overshadow the truths about working conditions in China. To their credit, they spend some time trying to get at the facts.

Today, I wanted to apply a list of filters to each item in a list, and return just those that pass each of the filters.
For example, given a range of integers, return just those that are divisible by 2 and by 3.
Let’s start by defining a boolean function divides:
Note that divides(2,_:Int) defines the (partial) function for division by 2.
So we can create our filters so:</description>

They treated the Amish with respect, neither nostalgically nor scornfully, with beautiful camera work, well-crafted stories, and good expert commentary. Personally, I especially enjoyed hearing some Amish singing, especially O Gott Vater, which I have never heard sung.
They told the story of the 2006 Nickel Mines tragedy, in which a man shot ten Amish girls in a schoolhouse, killing five of them, and of the amazing forgiveness the Amish showed the killer (who died in the attack) and the killer’s family.</description>

      <description>This is a followup to my post Computational lexicography on the cheap using Twitter, but more especially in response to Using off-the-shelf software for basic Twitter analysis.
The later article shows how to use database software (MySQL and its implementation of the SQL language) to do basic Twitter analysis. The ‘basic analysis’ includes counts by hashtag, timelines, and word clouds. They analyse about 475k tweets.
But here’s the thing: all their analyses can be done more simply with simple text files and pipes of Unix commands (as most eloquently demonstarted in Unix for Poets, by Ken Church).</description>

      <description>When I was in junior high school at Burton Junior High School — that is, grades seven and eight — Mr Leroy Herron was a very important man in my life. He was a school counselor, and a coach for the basketball team. He was also the sponsor of the Human Relations Club, a club created to get black kids and white kids like me to learn more about what I now might call anti-racism, but then we mostly called non-discrimination.</description>

      <description>This week, I started as the lead engineer for Wordnik‘s analytics platform. Except I get a little antsy about the term “engineer,” so I asked them to make my title “Lead, Analytics Platform.” It’s a real pleasure to work with the Wordnik team so far–super excited to be working with Tony Tam and Erin McKean, and also former Powersetters Colin Pollack and Robert Voyer. When Robert joined Wordnik over a year ago, I badgered him into getting me an interview–it’s only now that it’s come to fruition.</description>

      <description>It’s Ada Lovelace Day and we are encouraged to write about women who were significant in getting us involved in Science and Technology.
I remember my Junior High Geometry teacher, Miss Mullens. She was very, very short, kind of shy, but very funny — a classic geek, really, now that I think of it (geek, of course, being a term of praise here, not a negative thing).
Junior High school geometry, for me, was mostly about learning to do proofs — classic Elements of Euclid stuff.</description>

      <description>To implement a bloom filter, you need a bunch of hash functions. In naive implementations (and I’ve seen plenty), programmers pick out, say, five cryptographic hash functions. One problem with this is that the hash functions for bloom filters have different requirements than hash functions for cryptography–the latter tend to be more than is required for the former. What you want for bloom filters is something that’s very, very fast, while maintaining that basic desiderata for bloom filter hashing, uniform spread.</description>

      <description>Daniel Tunkaleng wrote an interesting blog post, “Retiring a Great Interview Problem” on an interview problem that he has, in the past, posed to interviewees, but which he has now retired, because someone posted the problem, and a solution, to an interview problem website. The problem is the segmentation problem (which he calls the word-break problem): given a string, segment it into reasonable words, if possible (for example, breaking “applepie” into “apple pie”).</description>

      <description>In the wake of the horrible killings in Norway, I saw several tweets and Facebook posts that were something like “Brown: terrorist. White: extremist. Got it.” or “It speaks volumes that the immediate assumption was that this was the work of Muslim terrorists.” In other words, people began quite quickly to comment on the media reaction to the story, criticizing (implicitly or explicitly) for being anti-Muslim. This seemed odd to me, because by the time I started to see stories about the killings, the stories themselves were tentative about what the motivations of the killer or killers were.</description>

      <description>Here’s a problem I faced at work: determine the effective top level domain of a URI, using the data from the Public Suffix List, but not using any data structures read into memory (ie, a dynamically created hash table or even a static array). For example, the effective top level domain of “http://blog.entish.org” is “entish.org”, because it is a name one could register.
So, there are about 4000 “positive” rules and about 100 “negative” rules.</description>

      <description>As kind of a 10-finger exercise, I decided to write a small inverted index library in Ruby today, since I had the day off. This is just a few thoughts about what it was like to write tests for this code, which can be found at [https://github.com/willf/inverted_index_simple]1–not that I think you’ll write the next major search engine with this bit of code…
What struck me was that as I was writing unit tests, how many of the tests failed at first either because of undefined variables or dynamic typing problems.</description>

      <description>There is a new iPad application out, a multimedia presentation of TS Eliot’s The Wasteland. I’ve only just begun to explore it. It seems to have its oddities, as all things do, I suppose: two pictures of Bob Dylan in the photo section, but only one of Eliot himself. But I’d never seen pictures of young Ezra Pound, and I thought—I know that guy, the confident artiste completely sure of his editorial prowess, more than willing to slash his way through the manuscript of The Wasteland; his edits are also included.</description>

      <description>I’ve started teaching myself the Go programming language. I’m enjoying most aspects of it. It feels like a really modern C–that is, low level enough to be fast, but with lots of the bells and whistles one comes to expect in a modern programming language. It has lots of data types, an interesting alternative to object-oriented programming called interfaces, a reasonably-sized library, support for concurrency baked into the language, etc. The Go home page says it well:</description>

Peter Norvig, one of the co-authors of the culturomics paper and the director of research at Google, was also the co-author on another significant article with the suggestive title, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”. The invention of the term “culturomics” suggests a scientific programme for attacking questions of culture that stresses statistical models based on large amounts of data, a programme that has been very successful both academically and commercially for linguistics and artificial intelligence, to say nothing of the informatics approaches of genomics and proteomics upon which the term culturomics is based.</description>

A response to “Faux Friendship,” by William Deresiewicz 1
Deresiewicz decries social networking sites, especially Facebook, especially in the way that relationships between users of Facebook are called “friends.” Writing a status message is “like pornography.” We have no time for stories. Our relationships are commercialized. We are overwhelmed with the number of false friends. Facebook “seduces” us. It’s a “mirage.” Facebook friends are simulacra of friends.</description>

“Another thing there is,” he says, ” that fixeth a grievous scandal upon that nation in matter of philargyrie, or love of money, and it is this: There hath been in London, and repairing to it, for these many years together, a knot of Scotish bankers, collybists, or coine-coursers, of traffickers in merchandise to and againe, and of men of other professions, who by hook and crook, las et nefas, slight and might, (all being as fish their net could catch), having feathered their nests to some purpose, look so idolatrously upon their Dagon of wealth, and so closely, (like the earth’s dull center), hug all unto themselves, that for no respect of vertue, honour, kindred, patriotism, or whatever else, (be it never so recommendable), will they depart from so much as one single peny, whose emission doth not, without any hazard of loss, in a very short time superlucrate beyond all conscience an additionall increase to the heap of that stock which they so much adore; which churlish and tenacious humor hath made many that were not acquainted with any else of that country, to imagine all their compatriots infected with the same leprosie of a wretched peevishness, whereof those quomodocunquizing clusterfists and rapacious varlets have given of late such cannibal-like proofs, by their inhumanity and obdurate carriage towards some, (whose shoe-strings they are not worthy to unty), that were it not that a more able pen then [than] mine will assuredly not faile to jerk them on all sides, in case, by their better demeanour for the future, they endeavour not to wipe off the blot wherewith their native country, by their sordid avarice and miserable baseness, hath been so foully stained, I would at this very instant blaze them out in their names and surnames, notwithstanding tbe vizard of Presbyterian zeal wherewith they maske themselves, that like so many wolves, foxes, or Athenian Timons, they might in all times coming be debarred the benefit of any honest conversation.</description>

 As I did for tweet, I downloaded tweets from Twitter; I just looked for occurrences of ‘texted. Not surprisingly, it was harder to find examples of texted than tweet[ed], but I did find a fair number of examples in a short time.</description>

Here are some clichés used in the article’s text. These are not examples they give, but clichés they use in the body text:
 Once you’ve spotted a cliché… they’ve lost their impact [they’ve] become stale Some people just tune out make a point [they may miss the point that you’re trying to make] use [something] as a starting point indispensable advice  At least they didn’t say “avoid clichés like the plague,” the clichéd anti-cliché joke.</description>

      <description>I have 100,000 tweets which were sent on 25 March, 2010. Of these, 2,522 had a token which matched the pattern ‘tw_t[_]’, which collected forms like ‘tweeted’ and ‘twittered’ (and forms like ‘twentysomething’ and ‘twilight’). I scanned these and found twenty examples of relatively clear uses of a past tense form of ‘tweet’ or ‘twitter’ (as a verb); there were only 21 of these. Of these 21, 20 where ‘tweeted,’ and the other was ‘twittered’ (It was actually ‘twittrd’, but I take that to be a mispelling).</description>

      <description>Geoffrey K Pullum, in Tweet this, a blog post at the inestimable Language Log, discusses the syntax of the neologism tweet and engagingly writes:
 Twitter merely coined a verb meaning “send a message via Twitter”, but they didn’t specify what linguists call its subcategorization possibilities. They added the verb to the dictionary, but they didn’t specify its grammar. The verb tweet is gradually developing its own syntax according to what it means and what its users regard as its combinatory possibilities.</description>

NPR reported on this in their story “Survey: Atheists, Agnostics Know More About Religion Than Religious,” and the LA Times did as well in their story “Atheists, agnostics most knowledgeable about religion, survey says.” For some reason, the actual report from the Pew Forum is unavailable as I write, but much of the details can be found at the online quiz.</description>

This seems like an odd misspelling to me, and I was curious how often this occurs. The Bing Ngram data gives us the tools: given “avoid like the”, the word “plague” occurs 98.68% of the time (in the web body data). The word “plaque” is the second most common word, occurring 0.</description>

If I were using a language with (compile-time) code macros (like Clojure, Scheme or Lisp), I’d prefer to write something like:
Measuring(&amp;quot;SomeFeature&amp;quot;){ComputeSomeFeature();} Measuring(&amp;quot;AnotherFeature&amp;quot;){ComputeAnotherFeature();}
But C# doesn’t have such a basic and useful thing, by design (bad design, I think, but still by design).
But C# does have first-class anonymous functions, so it’s possible to write methods that take one of these as a parameter.</description>

      <description>First mention in the New York Times of the expression “sanctity of marriage.”
 We cannot be silent on those laws of your country which, in direct contravention of God’s own law, ‘instituted in the time of man’s innocency,’ deny, in effect, to the slave the sanctity of marriage, with all its joys, rights and obligations. New York Times, December 15, 1852, Page 1.
 This is contra a claim in “Traditional Marriage Perverts the Tradition of Marriage,” that the phrase was invented in 2004.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing with Microsoft Research’s ngram server in my spare time. I’ll write some more about this in time, I hope.
The API returns base 10 logs for its probabilities. Because the probabilities returned are so very low, it makes more sense to return a log probability. I could be wrong, but I think it’s normal practice to return base 2 logs, or base e logs for log probabilities. They are easily to convert from one base to another, so it doesn’t really matter.</description>

This is a tune I had been leading a lot at Sacred Harp singings and conventions in 2009; I still like it. One silly reason is that the tune’s title indicates a goal of a good search engine. The title actually comes from an Isaac Watts poem about the difficulty of good marriage matches, according to Warren Steele.</description>

 DEAR MISS CLOVER: WIll you meet me outside the Canterbury at 7:30 to-night?</description>

      <description>I enjoyed reading the Wikipedia page about its “lamest edit wars.” One of these edit wars was whether the article on what Americans call “aluminum” and what Brits call “aluminium” should have, as its fundamental title, “Aluminum,” or “Aluminium.” And, one of the arguments presented in favo(u)r of “Aluminum” was that more Google hits are available for the US spelling than the UK spelling. “Ghits” is notoriously unreliable (as are Bing hits and the other search engines), since the number of search results reported are subject to lots of factors, not of which is tied directly to actual number of documents returned.</description>

      <description>Microsoft enters the mid oughties, and provides blog posting directly from Microsoft Word. Will it work, or no?
Actually, this is pretty cool. It seems to allow me to edit the current blog post, and even to assign categories. My cynicism is unbecoming.
But can I put in a table?

      <description>For Lent, I’ve decided to refrain from recreational checking of weblogs, Facebook and Twitter, starting February 17 until Easter Monday, April 5, 2010. I may be writing some weblog posts, and updating Facebook notes (and perhaps status), but after today, don’t expect to hear from me much except via the old ways, such as the Tele-Phone, Facsimile Transmission, and E-Mail. And F2F, of course.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I wrote about whether there was evidence that people tend to “buy a home and sell a house,” and used Google’s n-gram data (based on web documents) to suggest this wasn’t the case. I happened to come across this post today, and wondered whether some of the query streams I have access to now might say something to this. I looked at our frequently “sell” or “buy” co-occur with “house” or “home” in a stream of about 36 million queries.</description>

http://shewings.wordpress.com
Consider it a Christmas present.
Julian (or Juliana) lived in the English village of Norwich in the fourteenth century. She received sixteen “Shewings” (or “Revelations”) which she later wrote down; these were separated into 86 chapters. This weblog will post two chapters, one on Saturday, one on Wednesday.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin argues in his post Watch the money that one can tell a good life insurance salesperson by how much insurance they bought a lot of their own insurance; and you can tell a good non-profit person by how much they give to charity. Both of these statements seem right on the face of things, but are, I believe, false.
First, I think Mr Godin is (perhaps) confusing moral good and monetary achievement.</description>

  “new” for “knew,” even though “new” is properly spelled found a passive (though passives aren’t bad, of course; dull writing is bad) found a cliche, “like the plague” (which I hand-edited to “assiduously”)  Things it missed:</description>

Here’s how to move a self-hosted WordPress weblog to WordPress.com, by exporting to XML and reimporting at WordPress.com. Depending on the version of WordPress software you are running, these instructions might have to be adjusted. Just look around: the right button or link is somewhere to be found.</description>

      <description>There are two questions: Is driving while talking on a cell phone safe? and Is it as dangerous as driving while drunk?
After reviewing some earlier studies, and looking at a new Virginia Tech study, I’d say the answer is a definite yes to the first question; and a probably not to the second question (not as dangerous as driving drunk, but maybe “only” 1/4 as dangerous.)
Details follow. All of the papers below are available online, and discuss (for the most part) their methodologies and metrics.</description>

      <description>In 1970, when I was in eighth grade, I took a Current Events class. During the previous summer, Ted Kennedy drove his car into the Chappaquiddick, leaving his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, in the car; she was found dead the next day.
The case came up in Civics class. I defended Kennedy. My case, if I recall correctly, was that he was a Very Important Man–the brother of Jack Kennedy, our dear assassinated president, and of Robert Kennedy–hadn’t his family suffered enough?</description>

      <description>There is a void in the English language which, with some diffidence, we undertake to fill. Every one has been put in an embarrassing position by ignorance of the status of some woman. To call a maiden Mrs is only a shade worse than to insult a matron with the inferior title Miss. Yet it is not always easy to know the facts. When an author puts on the title page of a book Marion Smith, it is not even possible to be certain of the sex of the writer, and it is decidedly awkward for a reviewer to repeat the name in full over and over again.</description>

      <description>It has often been noted that English is deficient because it lacks a third-person pronoun that can refer to any person, without respect to sexual gender. Although some claim that “he” can refer to anyone in sentences like (1), most linguists agree that maleness is much more salient in these cases than a generic sense.
(1) Everyone should do his own work.
There are at least six common solutions proposed:</description>

So, it was convenient to do this—as if driving 13 hours one way is anyone’s idea of ‘convenient.</description>

I am very, very grateful for the time I spent at Reba Place Church (1990-1996, 1998 or so), and loved the music there. I was very grateful for the intentional way that the call to anti-racism worked itself out in music and worship. This included being part of the gospel choir, which developed my spirit and my musical abilities and helped me on an anti-racist path.</description>

      <description>I got discussing the idea of Gemütlichkeit with a friend today–actually the Danish expression “hygge”–but I was connecting it to Gemütlichkeit–and I made the claim that “homely” used to mean something like gemütlich.
And so it seems: the OED reports several senses of “homely” with gemütlich connotations. For example, “Become as one of the household; familiar, intimate; at home with”, now rare or obsolete. The first citation is from 865 ad.</description>

      <description>I’m sitting in the airport at O’Hare after the longest plane taxi ride I can remember. It doesn’t really matter how long it took since the flight left late, arrived late, and I have even longer to wait to get on a flight to Seattle. I was supposed to be in Seattle this morning, but a mix-up on tickets (that was my own fault) meant I couldn’t leave until this evening.</description>

      <description>Some of proclaimed the “end of blogging,” and it’s certainly the case that I haven’t written as much for this weblog recently. I do a lot of the teaching at our church, and more recently have been trying to write out my teaching notes and to send them to people who are interested or just unable to attend on a given Sunday. It’s a lot easier to do a teaching from an outline than to write everything down so that it’s semi-coherent, and that takes a significant amount of time.</description>

 We follow Jesus, who lived, died, and rose again to save us. He tells us to love God and to love our neighbor as ourselves.

      <description>From the Washington Post, “Big donors drive Obama’s money edge“:
 Lost in the attention given to Obama’s Internet surge is that only a quarter of the $600 million he has raised has come from donors who made contributions of $200 or less, according to a review of his FEC reports. That is actually slightly less, as a percentage, than President Bush raised in small donations during his 2004 race, although Obama has pulled from a far larger number of donors.</description>

This is similar in spirit to Tim Bray’s ‘wide finder’ project, and I’ve leveraged his popularity to find a useful utility created by Preston l. Bannister called “feed-workers” that implements the ‘map’ part of map-reduce (but over a large file, rather than a large set of files).</description>

      <description>(The usual disclaimers: my opinion only, not my current or future employers)
When Powerset began a couple of years ago, a lot of commentators called us — and still do call us — a would be Google killer. This, despite repeated comments by senior staff that this wasn’t what we were about. As a company, Google is hard to beat. Our goal was audacious, but not that audacious. Our goal was to build a better search experience: to use natural language technology to provide better search results, both by having a better understanding of web documents as well as user queries.</description>

 A final note on home ownership: MWDEU reports that “a number of commentators have remarked on the tendency to buy a home and sell a house”. I was curious to see whether this ‘tendency’ was real, so I checked the Google 3-gram data (see announcement).</description>

Seven factz about me:
 Will Fitzgerald didn’t use a computer until he was 23. It had cards. It is difficult for Will Fitzgerald to refer to himself in the third person. Despite his descriptivist linguistic training, Will Fitzgerald tries to distinguish ‘between’ and ‘among’. Will Fitzgerald was known as “Bill” until he was 33. Will Fitzgerald has half of a house named in his honor.</description>

 How many unique ways are there to acquire at least 270 electoral votes without any excess? I figured it would be a ‘large’ number, but I was surprised at the actual total: 51,199,463,116,367 (or, fifty-one trillion and change). about 2.3% of all possible combinations (This exact number is based on the simplifying assumption of treating Maine and Nevada as giving up their electoral votes in the same way as all the other states).</description>

I came across an earlier example from 1793, in Elder John Leland’s “The history of Jack Nips”:
 Like other boys, I wished to be in fashion, and as the Presbyterians were the most fashionable, I applied myself to the study of their books, but was not a little puzzled to reconcile their writings with my boyish thoughts.</description>

      <description>America the Beautiful has interesting linguistic properties. In particular, it uses verbs in the subjunctive mood, which is quite unusual in modern English, except in fixed expressions (such as “God forbid.”). The subjunctive is usually used to describe a condition that doesn’t exist, or a condition that one wishes to exist, such as “if I were a rich man.”
The interesting thing about the subjunctive in English is that it often indistinguishable from the simple past tense or a request/command form.</description>

 NEW YORK – The results of an internal Justice Department investigation released today reveal that officials at the highest level of government — including the White House — received reports on the abuse of prisoners in U.S. military custody overseas as early as 2002. Congress called on the department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to conduct the investigation after documents made public through an American Civil Liberties Union Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request revealed FBI agents at Guantánamo had raised concerns about methods used by military interrogators.</description>

      <description>The Detroit Free Press is reporting on a new plan to seat Michigan delegates at the Democratic convention. The idea is to give Clinton 69 regular delegates, and Obama 59. “The proposal also would seat the state’s 29 superdelegates.”
I suspect the hidden (Clinton) agenda is to seat the superdelegates.
Since these superdelegates were responsible for the mess we’re in, it would make more sense to me to split the delegates 64/64 between Clinton and Obama, and leave the superdelegates at home.</description>

      <description>Bush personally approved meetings to arrange torture, which were led by Cheney.
 If you consider what the government did to be torture, which is a crime according to U.S. and international law, Bush’s statement shifts his role from being an accessory after the fact to being part of a conspiracy to commit.

      <description>See it full size for the best effect, I think: Psalm 131. I made this slide show for worship this past Sunday, using CC photographs from Flickr, and music from Lindsay Phillips. It was prompted by Psalm 131:
Lord, my heart is not lifted up, my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like the weaned child that is with me.</description>

      <description>Bess has this Grand Plan: to canoe the Kalamazoo River from its headwaters (more or less) to Lake Michigan, and to do it in parts. Yesterday, the Grand Plan commenced. She and I drove to the Twin Lakes Campground near Pulaski Michigan, waking the attendants at 10 am, who dropped us off up river. Our river canoeing skills are rusting (well, mine were never very good to start with), but we managed to stay dry.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed the Golden Gate Sacred Harp Singing this past week in San Francisco, and even managed to record the afternoon session (not a great recording, but not terrible either; the altos were strong, but perhaps not as strong as they sound in the recording). The singing was chaired by Natalia Cecire, who is working on a PhD in English at U.C. Berkeley.
I found a great quotation, by the way, in Natalia’s draft of a MLA presentation she gave, “From Stone Tablet to Pensieve: Media and History in Children’s Fantasy“:</description>

 You protect your arms and hands legs and save your eyes. If you see a blasting cap remember now, don’t touch them. Tell a police or a fireman or whatever it is. Have fun like I do with those (baseball mitt, bat and ball) and not with these (blasting caps!!) Anyone I’ve ever met who is exactly my age in years and grew up near Detroit remembers this with fear.</description>

In a blog post, “Medicine and Statistics Don’t Mix,” Levitt tells the story of friends of his who spent $5,000 on Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) — a test for genetic viability of embryos — during fertility treatment. The test came back positive for the possibility of birth defects.</description>

But we have a hoop in the backyard, and I’ve decided to try to get ‘good’ at shooting foul shots. The advantage of foul shots, of course, is that you don’t have to move very much.
My first try was abysmal: 11/50. Yesterday was worse: 10/50. Today, almost, but not quite, not terrible: 19/50.</description>

      <description>For the few who might be interested: OpenDMAP: An open source, ontology-driven concept analysis engine, with applications to capturing knowledge regarding protein transport, protein interactions and cell-type-specific gene expression (PDF).
 OpenDMAP advances the performance standards for extracting protein-protein interaction predications from the full texts of biomedical research articles. Furthermore, this level of performance appears to generalize to other information extraction tasks, including extracting information about predicates of more than two arguments.</description>

      <description>From ‘In pursuit of the G-d shot‘:
 Millions of people probably get great coffee every morning with a standard home machine and ground coffee from a supermarket. I was starting to worry that, with a process that has as many variables as pulling an espresso, once you’re daft enough to go off piste, things get monumentally messy in a way only explicable with chaos theory. To go off piste is to go off the trail (in cross-country skiing, for example), to do something non-standard.</description>

      <description>More stuff worth reading: Joseph Stiglitz’s testimony before Congress on the cost of the Iraqi War (pdf):
 I have, so far, emphasized the direct economic costs as well as the opportunity costs—the diversion of funds that could have been used in so many other and better ways. I would be remiss, however, if I did not note that there are other costs: in the long run, the squandering of America’s leadership role in the international community, the diversion of attention from critical global issues, including issues like global warming and nuclear proliferation in North Korea—that simply won’t go away on their own, and that cannot simply wait to be addressed—may represent the largest and most longstanding legacy of this unfortunate war.</description>

      <description>Obama’s speech is well worth watching.
 For we have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division, and conflict, and cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle – as we did in the OJ trial – or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina – or as fodder for the nightly news. We can play Reverend Wright’s sermons on every channel, every day and talk about them from now until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words.</description>

      <description>Update: Good comments by Fred Clark at slacktivist.
From the New York Times:
 Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been an outspoken opponent of torture, often referring to his own experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. In this case he supported the administration’s position, arguing as Mr. Bush did Saturday that the legislation would have limited the C.I.A.’s ability to gather intelligence. So, McCain is in favor of allowing the US to practice such cruel and inhuman punishment and torture as:</description>

      <description>Should Michigan redo its Democratic primary for president?
I think it was shameful, scandalous and grossly stupid that our Governor Granholm, Senator Levin, and the state Democratic and Republican committees disenfranchised Michigan voters.
Millions of dollars were spent holding a sham election in which the only Democratic front-runner on the ticket was Senator Clinton. Her presence on the ballot was itself a masterful bit of triangulation, allowing her to garner votes while not spending any money on campaigning in Michigan and publicly committing to honor the Democratic National Committee’s rules.</description>

The Harmonia Sacra is a shape-note tunebook in the Mennonite tradition. Originally published in 1832 by Joseph Funk as A Compilation of Genuine Church Music, it has gone through twenty-six editions. This on-line version provides both seven-shape and four-shape (“Sacred Harp”-style) versions of tunes.
I created a website (static website, but generated with Ruby) using James Nelson Gingerich’s excellent newly typeset versions of this tune book.</description>

Now, we have a large array of choices, and this weekend we used quite a few of them, but it was interesting (and frustrating) to see the large array of troubleshooting techniques they required.
I watched a BBC production of Dorothy L. Sayers’s Gaudy Night using the ‘instant watch’ feature of Netflx.</description>

 One of the first questions when approaching the subject of human nature tends to be are we essentially good or essentially rotten? The Christian answer — “Yes!” — can seem like a cop-out, or a contradiction, or a paradox (the euphemism theologian’s use for those contradictions we like). The idea is that every human is of inestimable worth, bearing the very image of God through and through.</description>

      <description>Hitchens on the Iowa caucus racket:
I was in Des Moines and Ames in the early fall, and I must say that, as small and landlocked and white and rural as Iowa is, I would be happy to give an opening bid in our electoral process to its warm and generous a
 nd serious people. But this is not what the caucus racket actually does. What it does is give the whip hand to the moneyed political professionals, to the full-time party hacks and manipulators, to the shady pollsters and the cynical media boosters, and to the supporters of fringe and crackpot candidates.</description>

      <description>First mention: 1905 for Franklin Delano Roosevelt:
 Mrs. Valentine Hall has sent out invitations for the wedding of her grand-daughter, Miss Eleanor Roosevelt, to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The ceremony will take place at 4 o’clock, March 14, at 8 East Seventy-sixth Street, the residence of Mr. and Mrs Henry Parish Jr., with whom Miss Roosevelt makes her home. Eleanor and Franklin were fifth cousins, once removed, according to Wikipedia. The first mention of Eleanor was in 1894, in an obituary for her father, Elliott.</description>

`Worse than Failure posts about a silly function named:

Hah! If I’d written this in Lisp, it would be the much simpler:
remove_special_chars_except_quote&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;ampersand&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; apostrophe_open_bracket_close_bracket_comma&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;hyphen&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; full_stop_comma_forward_slash
which is why Lisp is so much better than Any Other Language.
(I tend to write functions that have names that are too long, which is why I thought this was funny. I wonder what the longest function name that I’ve ever written is?</description>

 It was New Year’s Eve, and things were finally starting to go right. Our car had broken down outside Forsyth, Ga., on Christmas Eve, and we had had to hitchhike to northern Florida to visit my mother, leaving our car at a garage for repairs. When we got back to Forsyth, the repair shop declared even more repairs were necessary, and we had to ask my wife’s parents to wire us some money.</description>

      <description>To-day, has been set apart by the State and City authorities as a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the mercies which have marked the closing year. It will, according to custom, be generally observed. We have all had abundant occasions for gratitude to God for blessings received at His hands. It is well to make public recognition of His goodness, and public acknowledgement of our dependencies upon Him for life and breath and all things.</description>

      <description>Great quote from Geoff Pullum at Language Log:
 You know, just between you and me, I sometimes worry that there is a naive view loose out there — most students come to linguistics believing it, and there appear to be some professional linguists who regard it as central and explanatory — that language has something to do with purposes of efficiently conveying information from a speaker to a hearer. What a load of nonsense.</description>

      <description>One year from now, we’ll be electing a new president and voting for new members of Congress. Has our next eight years ever been so predictable?
November, 1998. Hillary Clinton wins the election with a large electoral vote majority, and about 55% of the popular vote, the first woman elected president (with Barack Obama as the first African-American vice-president). Democrats gain control of both houses.

      <description>David G. Lockwood has died, reports the Linguist List.
David Lockwood was one of my professors when I did my degree in linguistics at Michigan State in the 70’s. He was (and remained, I think) an adherent of “stratificationalism,” a kind of constraint-based network theory of language. His classes were the closest I had to mathematical (remember, this was in the heyday of symbolist linguistic theory). I also took historical linguistics, structural (descriptive) linguistics and phonology from him.</description>

Obviously, not like current bulky bike helmets, but just as today it is almost unthinkable for someone to ride a bike without a helmet (at least for some people), I have been claiming that someday it will be almost unthinkable for to go outside without some kind of protection against impacts.
Well, it looks like my wacky dream may be coming true!</description>

      <description>There must be an antonym for ‘hype.’ To hype something is to engage in hyperbole about it: Apple products have generated their share of hype. (For example: Steve Jobs said, “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”) I don’t mean ‘anti-hype’ in the sense of telling the approximate truth about something, desengaño or dis-illusionment. But after the IPhone announcement, Steve Ballmer said, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.</description>

      <description>I was born William Alan Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald, of course is my family name, but I don’t have any real connections to ‘William’ or ‘Alan.’ My dad sometimes says I was named after my Uncle Allen, but if so, why isn’t my middle name spelled as he spells it? It doesn’t make sense.
So, as of now, I am changing my name.
I want a name that’s different. Really different. Different all the time.</description>

      <description>This past weekend, Bess, Jane and I attended the 50th anniversary of the founding of Reba Place Church, the church we attended in the 90’s when I was in graduate school and for a few years afterwards. Saturday was spent going though a decade by decade retrospective. Reba began as, essentially, a commune in the 50’s and experienced explosive growth through the 60s and 70s. They allowed non-communal members in the 80s and there were many aftershocks of many of the communal members becoming everyday variety congregational members.</description>

      <description>There’s a great interview by Sian Liu with Steve Newcomb, Powerset’s COO (and ultimately my boss). He describes life and work at Powerset, some of the risks, the culture of openness at Powerset, and why we don’t see Google as the enemy. Granted, it’s not a hard-hitting interview (Liu even says “I am looking forward to … exploring long-term career opportunties in Powerset,” which blunts one’s objectivity), but it gives a good picture of what Powerset is like.</description>

      <description>II can’t do justice to the vacation time we were privileged to have last week, but I wanted to write down a few things, even if it’s just for our own memories in the future.
The basic goal: go to Camp Fasola, a singing camp put on by the Sacred Harp Music Association, now in its fifth year. Dear wife Bess suggested we go, and so she, I, and our daughter Jane, along with two of Jane’s friends (Rachel and Emma) headed down to Alabama.</description>

      <description>I’ve glad Marti Hearst is writing for the Powerset blog from time to time. She’s written a nice post about antonyms (‘Opposites attract’), pairs of words which are ‘opposite’ in meaning.
I also enjoy reading The Atlantic’s Word Fugitive column, in which people are asked to come up with new (almost always humorous) terms for things and events. For example, “the moment of undignified vulnerability that people in airport security lines feel when they have to take off their shoes.</description>

 [H]owever easy it is to wax poetic about the modern-day miracle of Google, the site is also among the world’s biggest teases. Millions of times a day, users click away from Google, disappointed that they couldn’t find the hotel, the recipe or the background of that hot guy.

      <description>Today’s Earth and Sky discusses a few topics mildly dear to my lunatic heart. They discuss blue moons and time zones.
 When there’s a second full moon of a calendar month, it’s come to be called a Blue Moon. I like the careful use of “it’s come to be called,” since it is a bit controversial what “blue moon” means, and where it comes from. But I think they’re right that “the second full moon of a calendar month” is the most common meaning of “blue moon” these days.</description>

      <description>My dad loves to vote. He once paid to take a taxi just so he could vote in a local school election. He was very disappointed that he couldn’t vote in Michigan’s last gubenatorial race, so we worked hard on getting him registered in Kalamazoo township, where his nursing home is. Well, mostly this was done by Amy, the social worker at his nursing home, Tendercare of Westwood.
In turns out that it’s a school election that will be Dad’s first Kalamazoo-area vote.</description>

      <description> The uniqueness and immense pragmatic convenience of proper names in our language lie precisely in the fact that they enable us to refer publicly to objects without being forced to raise issues and come to agreement on what descriptive characteristics exactly constitute the identity of the object. They function not as descriptions, but as pegs on which to hang descriptions (Searle).

 On the other hand, I did recently read (in the Historic Missouri Newspaper Project online archives) a warning advertisement for one singing master who was a shyster and who absconded with funds collected for the school and for printing flyers, etc.</description>

One of the many things that it takes for a computer to “understand” text (as we are trying to do at Powerset) is for it recognize names and what they refer to. So for example, in the sentence “Maid Marian is the female companion to the legendary figure Robin Hood.”, a computer needs to see the names Maid Marian and Robin Hood are present, and have some kind of internal representation of Ms.</description>

      <description>I got an email today from Larry Hunter at University of Colorado School of Medicine, who writes to say that a DMAP-based parser was the “international world-champion” in the The BioCreAtIvE (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology) data text mining challenge. The chart above are the results from the Protein-Protein Interaction Task.
My colleague at Powerset, Jim Firby and I worked on some of the semantic parsing technology used by the Colorado group.</description>

      <description>This has been a delightful weekend. On Saturday, I attended the Golden Gate Sacred Harp singing in San Francisco (with a nice Après-chant at Philip’s house, nicely described by Linda, who also has pictures of the singing). In the morning today, Jeff Shrager took me to see redwoods and banana slugs and tidepools, capped by some nice bluegrass music at a cafe. Worship at Sojourners was also good.
Back in Michigan, I missed some cool things happening.</description>

      <description>Last night, we went to a Good Friday service which included a meal, and I sat down next to my very Republican friend, Butch, who never has anything good to say about government (despite, or perhaps because of, having been a government social services employee for years). We don’t usually talk politics–the gap between us is too large and our friendship too fragile for this–but he started complaining about recent proposals to raise taxes to fix Michigan roads.</description>

Imagine my delight that you can buy Alaga by by the case, only $30 for 12 24-ounce bottles (plus shipping).</description>

      <description>An interesting idea: Ficlets. Anyone can write a 1k story portion (a “fictlet”); anyone can write prequels and sequels to any ficlet. All under a Creative Commons 2.5 license.
Is this a “bite size medium,” or will a chains of ficlets (or the entire space of probabilities for a ficlet chain) become a “full meal medium?”
Somewhere in academia, a PhD thesis is waiting to be born.

 Like it or not, which often I don’t, we are actually in a battle, in a war. Being strong, being focused, being whole hearted and single-minded are painfully necessary….This isn’t a war of survival; this is a war of conquering. And in order to conquer, not just survive, we gotta get the Enemies ways and means out of our system.</description>

Our age to sev’nty years is set; How short the time! How frail the state! And if to eighty we arrive, We’d rather sigh and groan than live.

 In 1963, when the Rev. Vernon Tyson was pastor of Jonesboro Methodist Church in Sanford, he invited Dr. Samuel Proctor to preach for what was called Race Relations Sunday. Proctor, an African-American and one of the leading theologians in the United States until his death in 1997, was then president of North Carolina A&amp;amp;T in Greensboro.</description>

      <description>St. Basil, who lived from around 330-379 CE, is one of the “three hierarchs” of the Orthodox Church. I’ve just finished reading (in a translation by RJ Deferrai), an excellent essay On the distinction between ousia and hypostasis. In this letter, he writes very clearly about the Christian view of God as Triune, in particular explaining the meaning of the technical terms ousia (abstract being) and hypostasis (individual being).
It’s good as a piece of theology, but it’s also interesting as clear technical writing.</description>

      <description>Maggie Leonard, responding to Linda’s statement about singing Sacred Harp that I quoted recently:
 That says it all. I’m not a doctrinal Christian. I tried for years to accept the doctrinal view of Jesus, but couldn’t when I searched my soul. However, this music rises beyond doctrine and summons the spirit that moved among the apostles after Jesus’ passing. That spirit moves through us like water when we sing, cleansing and purifying.</description>

It was prompted by a statement in Bush’s State of the Union address: “Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required,” which should be (to be parsable) something like “To whom much is given, of them much is required.”
Liberman notes that this eventually goes back to the New Testament, specifically Luke 12:48, which, in King James’s Engish, is: “For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required.</description>

Jeff Shrager pointed his camera at the projector screen, and made iChat full screen. So, I guess I’m talking to myself here. Talk about an echo chamber!</description>

      <description>A ‘forword’ is a word in which all the letters are in alphabetical order, with no repeats. Here are the longest ones I could find, using a particular word list I have on my computer (all six letters):
abhors almost begins begirt beknot bijoux biopsy chimps chinos chintz dehort ghosty
If you allow repeats, there’s also ‘beefily’ and ‘billowy’ (at seven letters).
Backwords are the same, in reverse. The longest are (at seven letters):</description>

      <description>And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth. (John 1:14)
Let all mortal flesh keep silence, And with fear and trembling stand; Ponder nothing earthly minded, For with blessing in His hand, Christ our God to earth descendeth, Our full homage to demand.
King of kings, yet born of Mary, As of old on earth He stood, Lord of lords, in human vesture, In the body and the blood; He will give to all the faithful His own self for heavenly food.</description>

 He worked for me writing code to parse RAP System execution code under C++, I worked for him (and Joyce Park) doing webdev using Dynamorph, an unlamented language that preceded JSP and PHP and Ruby on Rails.</description>

You’ll want to make sure that the other people you talk to talk about things you want to talk about and are the kind of people you want to talk to.
I came close to becoming a ham radio operator back in the early 80’s until I realized that what ham radio operators talked about most (at least back then) was ham radio equipment.</description>

      <description>Jules Feiffer began writing children’s books in the early ’90s; his first children’s book, apparently somewhat autobiographical, was The Man in the Ceiling. Lovely wife got it out of the library, and I’ve read it this evening.
The story centers around Jimmy, a boy who isn’t much good in at sports (as a real boy should be), but who can draw cartoons very very well. He’s got a driven father, a forgetful mother who is a fashion designer; an older sister prone to tantrums, and a little overlooked sister prone to being a bit of a pest.</description>

      <description>After a week or so of unseasonably warm weather, we woke up to heavy, sleeting rain and promises of up to a foot of snow. School is called off, and probably most work sites are closed (but not for us telecommuters).
It must be hard to live in temperate climes where you can’t experience the joy of a snow day; or, as we say here in Michigan, Snow Day!!!!!!! My brother, the UPS driver, would probably use a different set of punctuation.</description>

      <description>Gulp.
David Smith at The Guardian hypes web 2.0 (or web 3.0) and writes “The new Google is … Powerset.”
Calm down, everyone. Read what Barney Pell (Powerset CEO), Lorenzo Thione (Product Architect) and Steve Newcomb (COO) are saying on their blogs, especially Barney’s comments on Google and Powerset in the Sunday Times:
 Search is in its early days, and natural language is the future of search. But it’s both difficult to enable natural language search at all, and to do it on a scale like Google is a harder matter still.</description>

      <description>Cool, the news is officially out: Powerset has raised $12.5 M in series A financing (our press release). Bambi Francisco wrote a story for MarketWatch, and did an interview with our CEO, Barney Pell. Great lead to Francisco’s story:
 So they must be crazy, have a high threshold for pain, or are certain to deliver a brilliant product, right? Update: And it feels even more real when it makes the New York Times (a Times blog, but still).</description>

What’s that you say, a company can’t have a blog? That there’s no difference between a company blog and a press release? Silly you: Press releases talk about the company in the third person, have an about section, and a media contact.</description>

      <description>I’ve just finished Mark Helprin’s picaresque novel Freddy and Fredericka. It’s a good book that could have been a great book–or, perhaps, a pretty good book that could have been a good book–with better editing. It’s conceit is wonderfully ludicrous: Freddy and Fredericka, the Prince and Princess of Wales, (based on Charles and Diana) are set the quest to reacquire the United States for the British Empire. They are parachuted into New Jersey under cover of darkness and face a number of American perils and adventures: fighting off a biker gang, traveling down Twain’s Mississippi, burgling modern art from the nouveau riche, tramping on freight trains.</description>

I enjoyed her most when she was slightly off script while reading–making side comments of various sorts about the topic at hand. I’d just finished reading Assassination Vacation on the plane back from vacation (her generally delightful book about the assassinations of Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley as well as their assassinators).</description>

Ed just bought a pretty cool chipper–he does a lot of part time work cutting down trees, and chipping them.
Even cooler, Ed bought an old firetruck from the Baldwin fire department. He hopes to put a pick on it to get up higher in the trees.</description>

First, he notes that these people, at the end of the day, must enjoy their work, and thus are worthy of being called sadists, sociopaths, sexual perverts or worse.

ITunes 7.0.x hasn’t worked for me at all for more than 10 minutes since I installed it. The 7.0.1 release did not fix any of the problems that I was having.

I’d just like to point people to a weblog post by Barney Pell, our CEO, on Powerset and Natural Language Search. For those who might wonder why I’m working for Powerset, Barney’s vision explains it well:
 Seen in this light, there is enormous room for fundamental innovation in search, as the game has only just begun.</description>

      <description>It’s looking as if Neil Armstrong did say “One small step for a man…” rather than “One small step for man…”; this is what he has always maintained as his intent (Houston Chronicle story; via /.).
Perhaps someday historians will correct it again to “That’s one small step for a man; one giant leap for humanity.”
Update: I should have been a bit more skeptical, I think. At least taken a closer look at the data, which David Beaver has now done in a post on Language Log.</description>

      <description>For Jane’s science class, we performed a science experiment at home (She is studying the scientific method again). Because Bess works with peppers, we designed a simple experiment to see which part of an Anaheim pepper is the hottest: the seeds, the flesh, the placenta or the stem. Bess carefully cut a small piece of the flesh and the placenta (she put the stem aside) about the size of a seed for each of us.</description>

      <description>A note I wrote to the Fasola discussion list, on whether ‘midst’ is archaic or not
Although my mama warned me never to discuss language usage in public forums, let me weigh in here a bit …
Here is the line from “On the swiftness of Time” posted by Jesse Pearlman Karlsberg:
Unthinking man! remember this, Thou, &#39;midst thy sublunary bliss, Must groan, and gasp, and die!  I think what is ‘archaic’ (that is, no longer in common use) about the use of midst here is its use as a preposition.</description>

      <description>Last night, i attended the annual Gymanfa Ganu (/gI’manfa ‘ganI/ at Salem Presbyterian Church in Venedocia, Ohio with good friend Samuel Sommers. A gymanfa is a Welsh hymn sing; Sam is a fellow Sacred Harp singer with relatives at Salem, and it was great fun talking with him to and from Venedocia. The singing itself was interestingly different from Sacred Harp singing. We sat in parts, but we had a director (Trevor Williams) who would instruct us and even stop us if he wanted to correct or encourage certain things.</description>

      <description>Here’s something very Sacred Harp: The Parting Hand, a site to record songs you’d like sung and other remembrances made at your own funeral. It’s a quick site Annie Grieshop and I put together over the past few days in our spare time.
“The Parting Hand” is the tune most frequently sung at the end of a Sacred Harp convention.
My Christian friends, in bonds of love, Whose hearts in sweetest union join, Your friendship’s like a drawing band, Yet we must take the parting hand.</description>

      <description>150 years ago (on August 27, 1856), Abraham Lincoln made his only visit to Michigan; he spoke in Kalamazoo’s downtown park as part of a rally for John C. Fremont, the first Republican nominee for President. There are a number of events taking place in Kalamazoo this weekend, sponsored, in part, by our local state senator (a Republican, natch, and against whom my brother-in-law Sandy Lipsey is running this fall).</description>

      <description>With the demotion of Pluto to a dwarf planet, there are reports that a new mnemonic is required to recall the order of the nine–er, wait, only eight–planets. In fact, Jason Kottke sponsored a mnemonics contest. Kottke is one of the first generation bloggers, along Meg Hourihan. They were the subject of a New Yorker article early on, as well as an update recently when they got married. Kottke doesn’t write very much about himself, though, so I was pretty sure my entry wouldn’t win, but I still like it very much:</description>

      <description>Rachel Miller Jacobs, of Kern Street Mennonite Church in South Bend, Indiana, was ordained yesterday. Rachel is one of the Goshen, Indiana Sacred Harp singers, and it was with great pleasure that some of us were able to sing as a prelude to her ordination service, which was marked by good prayers, lovely singing, an excellent call to ministry by one of her seminary professors, and much obvious love for Rachel by the congregration she serves as the minister of spiritual formation, and by Rachel for the people she serves and from whom she has learned.</description>

      <description>I think this is the first writeup of the company I work for, Powerset, that I’ve seen: Spying an intelligent search engine. Barney Pell, our CEO, is interviewed.
 Search engines try to train us to become good keyword searchers. We dumb down our intelligence so it will be natural for the computer,” said Pell, whose company, Powerset, is based in Palo Alto, Calif. “The big shift that will happen in society is that instead of moving human expressions and interactions into what’s easy for the computer, we’ll move computers’ abilities to handle expressions that are natural for the human,” he said.</description>

 The distribution of frequency to rank is an almost perfect lognormal curve for the 11 years (98% correlation). I was surprised to see that Liberty (137) has the biggest downward trend over the 11 year period — it’s ‘batting average’ dropped from .</description>

      <description>A confession: my wife bought some watermelon-flavored toothpaste for our daughter. She didn’t like it particularly, but I did. It’s a very strange translucent green, and it’s quite sweet; I suspect it’s the sweetness, not the strange color that I like.
When I was thinking about moving to San Francisco to work for the startup, I began to suspect that the toothpaste would run out about the same time as when I might come to the Bay Area.</description>

Two little things of note that will make me want to buy it: A new speech synthesis voice, Alex, that sounds quite good. And boolean operators in Spotlight, the full-text searching tool; plus search on file attributes. The later should have already been in Spotlight, in my humble opinion, but that’s one way Apple keeps getting my money…</description>

      <description>I’ve been quite enjoying reading The Barn at the End of the World, by Mary Rose O’Reilley, published by Milkweed Press. It reminds me a lot of the writing of Annie Dillard (who has her own website: ‘The Secrets of the Universe as Decoded by the Unhinged’): essays about mindfulness at the interface between the natural and artificial worlds, as well at the interface of the social and solitary life. O’Reilly has a kind of spiritual eclecticism (not only is she a Quaker Buddhist shepherd, but a former Catholic novitiate) that I find both appealing and a bit scandalous–why is this Quaker/Catholic bowing before a buddha?</description>

      <description>My life is pretty easy if this is the biggest complaint I feel the need to write about:
 We purchased a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson Reach Easyglide Pro Freshmint Floss, and have had the following problems: – there is so much wax on the floss, it is hard to use because it slips in our hands, – there is so much wax on the floss, it is hard to get between our teeth, – it is almost impossible to cut the floss using the included cutter, – the cutter and feeder are poorly attached to the body, and so collapsed when trying to cut the floss, – the idea of having a ‘pro’ floss stikes us as silly as best and insulting at worst, – we resent having to pay extra for non-functioning products (often, we are unable to purchase J&amp;amp;J’s basic waxed floss because stores do not carry it).</description>

      <description>It was a very good singing today in Goshen; as Mark Miller has remarked, it’s a bit like singing inside the body of a guitar. Lots of southern singers, a very fierce alto section, excellent food. It was stifling hot–in the high 90’s, I think, and humid–but somehow that was all right. Sam Sommers: we’re going to take a break now, and be sure to try and rehydrate yourselves, and if you can’t do that, at least drink some water.</description>

 faith-based (adjective): affiliated with or based on religion or a religious group : a faith-based plan that bilked investors out of millions. USAGE The preponderance of usage for this term today connects it with institutions and programs that are affiliated with an organized religion, and with President George W. Bush’s faith-based initiative, which enables religious institutions doing social work to receive government funding.</description>

He investigates how many pages are returned for a search for the new word “ségolisme” (for which he can control at bit for precision numbers), and how many of these are duplicates due to RSS feeds, etc. A money quote:
 So, what are all these pages that Google considers to be similar? On closer inspection we can see that they are mainly RSS versions of the same page, archived pages (a blog often presents the same post in an individual version and also in a weekly or monthly archive), versions of posts both with and without comments, and links such as “trackback” or “new comments”, which are also commonplace on blogs.</description>

      <description>In the first chapter of Don Quixote, Cervantes introduces us to the modest straights of “the Ingenious Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha” by describing his diet:
 Una olla de algo más vaca que carnero, salpicón las más noches, duelos y quebrantos los sábados, lantejas los viernes, algún palomino de añadidura los domingos, consumían las tres partes de su hacienda. I’ve just started reading Edith Grossman’s new translation, and it contains the first paragraph from several English translations.</description>

      <description>Mark Liberman (to whom I emailed about Zonker’s use of ‘my brave‘), wrote about ‘My adjective‘ on Language Log. As usual, he has interesting things to say. He points out that
 One small issue is that second-person forms like “your idiotic” are homophonous with the corresponding clausal forms “you’re idiotic” etc. But that sort of ambiguity between innovation and conservatism may be an advantage.
 I began to wonder whether complex adjectival phrases will eventually be allowed in “My ___” forms.</description>

      <description>Zonker Harris says, “My brave” in analogy to “My bad.” Will “my+evaluative adjective” catch on? Mark Liberman wrote about the possibility previously. I mentioned this to a (way more cool than me) friend, and he said he was like totally going to use it.</description>

      <description>Our daughter Janine was baptized this morning by the Kalamazoo River at Historic Bridge Park near Battle Creek, Michigan, presided over by Pastor Tom Schwartz and Elder Eldon Christophel. This is a (rare!) family picture of us all together: Will, Bess and Mark Fitzgerald, Janine Fitzgerald in front. She was baptized along with eight other youth from our church. Leanell Schwartz taught the baptism preparation class.

Addendum: I wrote the following additional verse to Foreign Lander for Bess:
I’ve been to California, Our fortune for to seek, I sit among the mighty, Though I am mighty meek.</description>

Eiffel had at the top. I think I read about this before, but they’ve placed effigies of Eiffel and his daughter Claire entertaining–get this–Thomas Edison, who, in the English translation, is listed as an ‘American physician and inventor.</description>

 The Emerging Church: This is a term that refers to churches attended exclusively by white people in their 20s and 30s who have at least one tattoo or body piercing. Their distinguishing characteristics are a refreshing, “up to date” interpretation of Christianity, and a reluctance to directly answer questions. He also explains the code from Vinci:</description>

      <description>Dear Liz,
How we loved you. You were such an example to us when you started the “Bread Box,” a local restaurant and meeting place, to provide nutritious, home-made food inexpensively. And you did it when you were in your late 60’s–as part of your “outward journey” to serve God in the world, which also included your leadership in the local Bread for the World group.
When Yofi, our beloved cat, scratched our new baby’s face out of jealousy, and we had to find it a home, you took Yofi in, and made her fat and happy.</description>

      <description>From The Mennonite Weekly Review:
 The manuscript of the first protest against slavery in North America — written in Germantown in 1688 by a group that included Quakers and former Mennonites — has been rediscovered more than 50 years after it was last seen. The document was uncovered this spring in the vault at the Arch Street Friends Meetinghouse in downtown Philadelphia, according to Randy Nyce, director of the Germantown Mennonite Historic Trust.</description>

      <description>What is the equivalent of testosterone for geeks? I mean, besides testosterone? I went to the Nutch meeting at the Rite-Spot Cafe (a delightfully greasy spoon not far from my house, actually), and sat around a loud, long table with (fellow) geeks talking about search and map-reduce and clusters and regression testing and spidering. The noise level became VERY LOUD and so I left to come home and sleep (though I’m writing this instead).</description>

      <description>We attended the memorial service for Esther Chistophel this weekend. What a lovely service, and we learned a bit more about her last days and hours. She went to a hospice, where family and friends were welcomed. She was attended by most of her extended family. On her last day, several family members came to sing at various times. So did our pastor’s wife, Leanell, whom Esther love to hear sing.</description>

      <description>I want to record the passing of two dear friends.
Ruth Christophel was a very dear woman, the oldest and sweetest person in our small Mennonite church, the wife of the founding pastor. She lived a long full life, and desired to go home to be with Jesus.
Esther Chistophel was a good friend to many, including Bess and me: we almost always sought her out for a word or two at church services, because she was so kind and loving and interested in the world around her.</description>

Safari died a spectacular death when testing out the AutoComplete feature, though. I guess that’s one reason they’re still calling it a beta test. I really wish I’d had this library available when I did the NASA mission planning interface.</description>

      <description>Extremely surprising article at über-evangelical Christianity Today: Messy Revelation: Why Paul would have flunked hermeneutics by historian and biblical studies expert Susan Wise Bauer. It’s a very positive review of a book by Peter Enns titled Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament. Enns argues that the New Testament writers interpreted the Hebrew scriptures in the writers’ own social and cultural context–the writers had come to believe in Jesus as the resurrected Messiah, and then found evidence in the scriptures.</description>

      <description>San Francisco has always been a favorite city. It has so much beauty, both natural and man-made, and the natural and the man-made coexist so well. The great symbol of this is, of course, the Golden Gate bridge, its beautiful symmetry linking the city to the glories of Marin County, rising above the bay, perhaps enveloped by clouds.
This is the first time I’ve lived in the city, though, and I think what has struck me most has been the people–there are lots of ’em, and many different kinds.</description>

With the talk of new immigration laws in the air, some immigration activists are calling for a ‘stay-at-home’ protest on May 1. I’m starting my new job then, so I don’t think it would be wise to not go to work on my first day… But it did encourage me to write to my US representative and senators:</description>

 It looks like I have a place to stay until fall (at least): the Church of the Sojourners is planning to let me stay as a guest member. This makes me very happy. I had great fun singing at the 2nd Annual Golden Gate Sacred Harp Convention this past weekend. I even met someone who already knew by because of things I post to the Internet.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow I leave for California–here’s the plan: I have one more week to work at NASA, and then, on May 1, I start at Powerset, a new search company. Exciting, and a bit scary: the plan is for me to be in California (say) three weeks per month and (say) one week in Michigan. Bess is on board with this, but we’re all a bit daunted at being apart so much.</description>

Kalamazoo
On the outskirts are celery marshes Which only a few years ago Were as wet as a drugstore in Kansas And as worthless as marshes could grow, Well some genius bethought him to drain them And to add in a short year or two About eighty-five thousand dollars To the income of Kalamazoo.</description>

      <description>The Christian Century has a series of articles by Gordon Atkinson, the “Real live preacher.” The first one, How to find a church is quite good. His sermon from Cornell, The Richest Man in Town, a retelling of Jesus and the Rich Young Ruler, is wonderful.</description>

      <description>John Lamb has posted an order form for his recording of the 2006 New Year’s Harmonia Sacra singing at Goshen. I previously noted that John had put several lessons up on the Pilgrim Production website. As I said then, I’m really looking forward to this recording. John has several other recordings available, too.</description>

      <description>From Andrew White’s homily for Easter:
 The … Church has faced many questions. Will the church divide or split? Is there really hope that the Church will grow? What will happen about the issue of homosexuality? In Baghdad these questions are irrelevant. My congregation will, too, have questions: Will their children return from school? Will there be food on the table tonight? Who will be the next to be killed or kidnapped?</description>

 So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. in an email note today, basically as an excuse for why something I’ve been working on probably won’t be finished on time, and why we should probably revert to an older version. This is just one of the many advantages of a sort-of liberal arts undergraduate degree: better sounding excuses.</description>

      <description>I’m not a theologian, but I’m not alone in thinking that traditional evangelicalism (especially with its increased association with political conservatism) seems an inadequate response to a theology that fits well with Christian “experience and doxology.” In fact, I discovered what is almost a manifesto: Postconservative Evangelicals Greet the Postmodern Age. For example:
 Postconservatives tend to be impatient with exclusive claims to “the correct interpretation” of the Bible or tradition.</description>

      <description>Garry Wills on Christ Among the Partisans – New York Times
 THERE is no such thing as a “Christian politics.” If it is a politics, it cannot be Christian. Jesus told Pilate: “My reign is not of this present order. If my reign were of this present order, my supporters would have fought against my being turned over to the Jews. But my reign is not here” (John 18:36). Jesus brought no political message or program.</description>

The page is Christian Harmony Recordings, and contains all of the MP3 files from Tom’s four Christian Harmony CDs, including his latest, Newfound Hills, which is an interesting ‘teaching CD’ with Tom singing all four parts.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time–back in the early 80’s–I taught English as a Second Language. A number of my students were Bahá’ís from Iran. I remember one student in particular who wasn’t doing very well, and whom I had to ask to come to my office to discuss her academic situation. It turned out that she was very motivated to correct any problems she was having, because if she failed and lost her student visa, she would have to return to Iran, and face the ongoing persecution of Bahá’í believers by the Shia-controlled government.</description>

According to the online Scrabble dictionary, “obit” is just fine. Grandma was right.</description>

 Dear God, I am unsure of what is right because there are people I respect on both sides of this issue. But I cannot stand against my friends and remain emotionally healthy. It will kill me to stand against them. I cannot do it. Forgive me for my weakness, my fear, my unwillingness to take chances, and for all the times when I have been wrong and believed the wrong things.</description>

      <description>The word of the day is subreption.
I asked the following question on the Linguist List:
 Words like ‘to dial’ and ‘key’ and ‘album’ take on a shifted meaning as the underlying technology changes. Wordnet, for example, still defines ‘to dial’ as something like ‘to enter a telephone number using a dial.’ Of course, most dialing now occurs via push-buttons. Similarly, keys are now often made of a plastic card (or are completely virtual), and an ‘album’ can be a CD.</description>

The US government should spy on people to prevent terrorism, but they should do so in a way the protects the privacy rights of citizens.</description>

Many of her family come up north for her birthday singing–I think I heard that some 30 people came for her 91st birthday.</description>

      <description>Many interesting stats, including:
 White evangelical Christians were solidly behind the president throughout his first term in office, but that support has waned over the past 15 months. Currently, just 54% of white evangelicals approve of the president’s job in office, while 36% disapprove. Bush’s support has also dropped among people who attend church each week or more frequently. According to post-election exit polls conducted by the National Election Pool, these voters backed Bush over Kerry by a 61%-38% margin.</description>

One gave me a good show as it came in across the highway to attack its prey on the center strip.</description>

Lesser oppressors came and surrounded me as well. Surrounded my friends, and me. Yet I held out the Light, even as they hid us, And pursued justice in places of fear and anger.</description>

      <description>From Bridging the Church Music Gap, Sojourners Magazine/March 2006
 [A] number of churches that approach music from one pole or the other also dabble in less familiar material. Organists gamely plod through choruses, and praise bands rock out on old warhorse hymns. … But too often, this sort of music is programmed as an exception to the dominant pattern of whichever polarized model. Thus the overall tone of a service’s music—a deal-breaker for many people—is not really changed.</description>

      <description>My father celebrates his 75th birthday on Monday, February 27. Three of my four brothers were able to come to a party to help him celebrate: from left to right: Ed, Dave, Dan, me; Dad (Harold) in the center. Steve attended virtually. Kudos to his nursing home, Tendercare of Westwood , for helping make this happen. (Also there: Dan’s wife Lynn, Dave’s wife Joanie, Ed’s wife Amy and son Davie, Bess, Mark and Jane.</description>

      <description>In-car navigation systems can be distracting (1) Well, duh. (2) The article provides no details. This was probably an online poll conducted by YouGov by Privilege Insurance, a UK company. It’s hard to say whether there’s any chance of the survey being accurate, since no details are given in the Computerworld story (which might just be a Reuters reprint), and the study isn’t mentioned, as far as I can tell, on Priviledge’s website.</description>

      <description>So the Financial Times has a pretty good article on weblogging, Time for the last post (via kottke), but snarks about Orwell:
 The great critic and editor Cyril Connolly fell into despair over the prolixity of Orwell’s wartime writing: “Being Orwell, nothing he wrote is quite without value and unexpected gems keep popping up. But O the boredom of argument without action, politics without power.” Connolly was the constitutional opposite of Orwell – a spry wit given to sloth, a portly bon vivant who masticated away his genius.</description>

      <description>I just got a reprint of William Billings’s Continental Harmony, which I guess is the last tunebook he published. The first tune is “An Anthem for Thanksgiving.” (You can hear it here: WGUC 90.9 FM | Feast for the Ears; it’s the first tune in the 2005 program). The first part of the text is taken from Psalm 148, and then continues with these great words:
Ye dragons whose contagious breath, People the dark abodes of death, Change your dire hissings into heavenly songs, And praise your maker with your forked tongues.</description>

      <description>I came across this quotation in an email today:
 La grammaire, avec son mélange de règle logique et d’usage arbitraire, propose au jeune esprit un avant-goût de ce que lui offriront plus tard les sciences de la conduite humaine, le droit ou la morale, tous les systèmes où l’homme a codifié son expérience instinctive. (Marguerite Yourcenar, Mémoires d’Hadrien). Here’s my translation:
  Grammar, with its mixture of logical rules and arbitrary use, provides a child with its first exposure to the frameworks for human conduct that will confront it later: law, morality, every system that humanity has devised to order instinctive experience.</description>

      <description>According to this article at Military.com, Bush sent a request for $439.3 billion defense budget for FY 2007, a seven percent increase. This does not count the ongoing cost of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which, the article states, currently cost over $80 billion per year.
Hmm, the US Census says there are about 105 million households (2000 census data). Let’s round down the budget request to $500 billion, and the household population to 100 million; this means Bush is asking for $5,000 per household.</description>

In fact, the script sounds more like an ad for English assimilation–the son doesn’t seem to speak much Spanish; ¿y porqué habla el papá el inglés con su hijo dentro el espacio privado de un coche unless this is the goal?</description>

 With more than 10,000,000 copies sold since it first appeared in 1960, “To Kill a Mockingbird” exists as one of the best-selling novels of all time. For decades, Ms. Lee has remained fiercely mindful of her privacy, politely but resolutely refusing to talk to the press and making only rare public appearances, in which she always declines to speak.</description>

      <description>As part of the Autonomous Rotorcraft Project, I was the main developer on the Mission Planner Interface (MPI). It’s a browser-based tool (requiring Firefox 1.5, Safari, or the latest Opera beta) that allows definition of observation targets that are sent off to the mission planner, which then creates a plan to visit all of the targets and then controls the heliocopter as it carries out the mission. One cool technical trick is that the MPI uses the new-fangled ‘Ajax’ ideas to talk to the plan execution system (well, talks to a server that talks to the system) so that, for example, the position of the helicopter is shown on the map, and to provide pan-and-zoom features (a la Google Maps).</description>

      <description>We demo’d the Autonomous Rotocraft Project at Moffett Field today–not just any demo, but the “5 year demo,” the capstone of the project. I was a bit nervous, since I had a major role to play in the demo script, but hadn’t actually been able to practice with the real helicopter. There was a tricky bit where I had to induce a simulated ‘communication fault,’ so the helicopter could respond in a useful way–but it had to be done at just the right time; that is, where a communication fault could occur and be successfully taken care of.</description>

      <description>David W. Music of Baylor led a Sacred Harp workshop at the Calvin Symposium on Worship at Calvin College today. A good number of people where there– a hundred or more, including very large alto and treble sections. They were good, experienced singers who, for the most part, were unfamiliar with Sacred Harp singing.
David did a masterful job of leading people through the shapes and eleven tunes. He started with Martin, a good choice for new Sacred Harp singers struggling with the shapes because there is a lot of repitition and it’s ususally sung slowly.</description>

      <description>We have a big demo next week that requires at least one rain-free morning on Tuesday or Wednesday, so I’ve been checking the weather forecasts. One thing I’ve learned is that the National Weather Service publishes ‘forecast discussions.’ These give the rationale for the government’s weather forecasts. For example, from today:
 After Sunday…the forecast becomes much less clear. Over the past several days…there has been significant variation in solutions both run-to-run of the same model and between the different longer-range models.</description>

When I was a poor undergraduate student, I had a copy of the compact OED, but I had to sell it to buy food or something. By the time I got to graduate school, Northwestern had online access to the OED. Ah, I thought, I’ll never be without the OED again. But as soon as I left the university, I lost it.</description>

      <description>Nice essay by Natalia: On outsourcing art.
 Singing is a particularly sticky issue. There’s something horribly personal about letting a sound that’s unique to your body come out of your belly, susceptible to being heard by others — a bodily emission rendered as sound. Could such a thing ever be wanted? Even playing a cello (that lengthy embrace) is more detached. There’s an element of that embarrassing affect, enthusiasm, that’s necessarily present in singing.</description>

      <description>The very government itself seems an organized scramble, and Congress a boys’ debating-club, with the disadvantage of being reported. As our party-creeds are commonly represented less by ideas than by persons, (who are assumed, without too close a scrutiny, to be the exponents of certain ideas,) our politics become personal and narrow to a degree never paralleled, unless in ancient Athens or mediaeval Florence. Our Congress debates and our newspapers discuss, sometimes for day after day, not questions of national interest, not what is wise and right, but what the Honorable Lafayette Skreemer said on the stump, or bad whiskey said for him, half a dozen years ago.</description>

      <description>Neil P. McAngus Todd and Bjorn Merker, in Siamang gibbons exceed the saccular threshold: Intensity of the song of Hylobates syndactylus, states:
 While evolution has produced in all classes of vertebrate a great diversity of vocal courtship displays, loud synchronous chorusing employing amplitude summation of multiple voices may have played a special role in human evolution. The abstract from Todd and Merker’s paper:
  Measurements are reported of the intensity of the siamang gibbon loud call obtained from the vocal bouts of three family groups at Twycross Zoo, UK.</description>

Yahoo reports 46.6 and 907 kGhits (kYhits?), respectively. Is it being sexist to use ‘unmanned’ when it refers to the absence of a pilot? Well, of course it is.</description>

      <description>Guy Steele in DDJ, Thoughts on Language Design: discusses going beyond the structured programming constructs of loops, if-then-else, and sequential operation:
 What might a language look like in which parallelism is the default? How about data-parallel languages, in which you operate, at least conceptually, on all the elements of an array at the same time? These go back to APL in the 1960s, and there was a revival of interest in the 1980s when data-parallel computer architectures were in vogue.</description>

 “I have an audiologist friend at Wichita State University who actually pulls off earphones of students he sees and asks, in the interest of science, if he could measure the output of the signal going into their heads,” Garstecki said. Often he finds students listening at 110 to 120 decibels. “That’s a sound level equivalent to measures that are made at rock concerts,” said Garstecki.</description>

 Not necessarily, according to Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Richard Skinner. According to his written testimony, one UAV requires a crew of up to 20 support personnel. In fact, the operating cost is more than double that of a manned aircraft.

The CPT team was in Iraq investigating abuses by the occupying forces (they provided some of the first news on Abu Ghraib and other abuse cases in Iraq). Their motto is being “committed to reducing violence by ‘Getting in the way,&amp;rsquo;” which means putting themselves in dangerous spots just so violence may be reduced because of public pressure, changes of heart, putting on spotlight on abuse, etc.</description>

      <description>I saw the Chronicles Of Narnia movie this weekend. My biggest fear was that Disney would tinker with the story too much; this fear was unfounded. It’s a respectful and fairly faithful telling of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan is still not a tame lion, and is good, not safe, and Professor Kirke still wonders What do they teach at schools these days? I doubt that the movie will evoke much Sehnsucht.</description>

      <description>From Harold Pinter’s 2005 Nobel lecture:
 The United States supported and in many cases engendered every right wing military dictatorship in the world after the end of the Second World War. I refer to Indonesia, Greece, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Haiti, Turkey, the Philippines, Guatemala, El Salvador, and, of course, Chile.
 He also describes the support for the Contras in Nicaragua.

      <description>It’s hard to believe I’ve never tried it before, but I finally did today, and I liked it. Maybe I’ll do it every Monday, then maybe I’ll try it on Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, and work up to the hard stuff on Sundays. It was fun, my wife turned me on to it. What I tried was pretty tame by her standards–she does the really hard stuff, stuff that takes over her brain sometimes for days at a time before it’s done and she can return to normal life.</description>

      <description>[Belated Blog against racism day essay]
Many, if not most, institutional systems in the United States were explicitly, and without apology, created with racist intentions. Our constitution declared ‘Persons held to Service or Labour’ (that is, black slaves) to be worth only three-fifths of a regular citizen with respect to representation. Educational systems were set up as separate systems for blacks and whites. Housing covenants were written to restrict blacks and other minorities from living in certain neighborhoods.</description>

      <description>The first half of the manuscript of Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which was begun in 1876 and published in 1885, was discovered in 1990 ‘in an old steamer trunk stored in the attic of a Los Angeles house.’ It includes a description of a camp meeting that is more expansive than the published version. I thought the readers of this mail list would be interested in the published and manuscript versions of the beginning part of the story, in which a preacher is lining out a hymn.</description>

      <description>Tim Converse reports on recruiting trip to Michigan he made–that is, Michigan the University. He asked the audience trivia questions, including “how many trailing zeros in 100 factorial?”
I remember seeing 100! for the first time:
93,­326,­215,­443,­944,­152,­681,­699,­238,­856,­266,­700,­490,­715,­968,­264,­381,­621,­468,­592,­963,­895,­217,­599,­993,­229,­915,­608,­941,­463,­976,­156,­518,­286,­253,­697,­920,­827,­223,­758,­251,­185,­210,­916,­864,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000
I wondered where all those (24) zeroes came from, but I never took the time to figure it out.
Nor did I have time to figure it out as I read Tim’s post, but I did have a couple of minutes to write a Lisp program to compute n!</description>

      <description>Interesting article Why are American presidential election campaigns so variable when votes are so predictable? (pdf) by Andrew Gelman and Gary King. First, I didn’t know that presidential elections were so predictable, but apparently they are (close races are predictably close, not-so-close races are predictably not-so-close) based on certain relatively well-known independent variables. Second, the authors make a good case about why voter polls are so variable. Basically, people eventually gather enough information to make a decision based on their real preferences; and at the point (which is usually near the election).</description>

Homily by a Fr. Jim Tucker:
 Si algo toca nuestro vivir, tiene que ser sometido al imperio del Rey Crucificado.
 What does “Viva el Cristo Rey” show up on serveral Persian blogs? For example, this one.
Can one be politically somewhat leftist and shout “¡Viva el Cristo Rey!” without too many echos of Francoist terrorism?

      <description>Daughter Jane is taking an ATYP writing skills course, part of which is learning about the standard logical fallacies. Unfortunately, the website that hosted a good list of them, by Mike LaBossiere, has been down for a while. Fortunately, LaBossiere has allowed us to republish them, and so here it is: A Fallacy Recognition Handbook.</description>

      <description>I attended a geek salon at halflab, and several of the attendees started discussing The Time Traveler’s Wife, Audrey Niffenegger’s first novel. Henry DeTamble has a problem: he has a genetic disorder that causes him to travel through time; unfortunately, he has little control over where and when, except he gravitates to significant points in his life, both past and future. What this does to his life, the life of his eventual wife (Clare Abshire), and their friends and family is handled intelligently and vividly, for the most part.</description>

I wrote this letter to Time:
 I’m fairly appalled at the patronizing tone Joel Stein takes in his column ‘What’s next…with the Amish,’ as posted on-line Oct 17: Stein could have chosen to ask how the Amish go about making decisions about new technologies rather than making fun of them or assuming that many are looking for ‘loopholes’ that would allow them to use cell phones and Rollerblades.</description>

      <description>Really good Kalamazoo Sacred Harp singing yesterday. There were only six people when we began to sing, but with Roger Williams singing bass, Molly Williams on alto, and Ann Miczulski singing treble, and the always strong leading tenor of Samuel Sommers, we were well covered. We started with lots of minor plain tunes–Mear, Wells and the like. We sang Stafford, the object of some controversy because of its words, because some of us didn’t even know how it sounded (with some instructions on how to change the words, and explicit permission not to sing).</description>

      <description>From Samuel Butler’s The Book of the Machines in Erewhon:
 Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may [a machine] not become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand? For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.</description>

      <description>I received an email from Justin Bur that says (quoting with permission):
 Your English version of Borges’ celebrated essay http://www.entish.org/essays/Wilkins.html contains a rather spectacular mistranslation based presumably on a typo in the original Spanish. Section 16 of Wilkins’ taxonomy classifies the *whale*, not beauty, as a viviparous oblong fish. There is a complete text online at http://reliant.teknowledge.com/Wilkins, and the relevant passage is on page 132. The confusion seems to arise from the graphic similarity between “ballena” (whale) and “belleza” (beauty) in Spanish.</description>

 Setting up a possible veto showdown with the White House, the Senate voted overwhelmingly for an amendment to a Pentagon spending bill that sets standards for the treatment of prisoners in U.S. military custody. The measure, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, would require American troops to follow interrogation standards set in the Army Field Manual and bar “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” of prisoners in U.</description>

      <description>Is this a potential solution to the production of hydrogen-fueled cars? Danish Researchers Reveal New Hydrogen Storage Technology. What are the possible pollution side-effects?
 In the process described in the article, ammonia (NH3) is produced as an intermediate step. The biggest challenge of this technology is creating a safe fuel tank that can hold ammonia, which can be harmful or fatal to people and animals in the vehicle, because: NH3 is immediately toxic at 500 ppm, NH3 reacts with water, producing ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), producing a lot of heat (‘exothermic reaction’) which could (say) blow up the car, NH3 is very cold when it is vaporized.</description>

      <description>A Linguist’s Alternative History of ‘Redskin’
 By this time [1769] the original colonial designations of “Christian” and “Indian” were giving way to “white,” “red” and, with the increase in slave traffic, “black”: “Color didn’t originate with Indian-white relations but with slavery,” said University of Connecticut historian Nancy Shoemaker. “It is slavery that makes color seem to be a way to organize people.”
 But the original use probably came from Native Americans themselves, says Ives Goddard.</description>

      <description>I’m not sure this is available to the general public, but Don Norman has an intriguing article Human-centered design considered harmful.
 Human-centered design has become such a dominant theme in design that it is now accepted by interface and application designers automatically, without thought, let alone criticism. That’s a dangerous state—when things are treated as accepted wisdom. The purpose of this essay is to provoke thought, discussion, and reconsideration of some of the fundamental principles of human-centered design.</description>

      <description>600 barrels of loot found on Crusoe island
 This most recent announcement, however, deserves greater credence because of the equipment used by the treasure hunters: a mini robot that can scan 50 metres deep into the earth. The robot, dubbed “Arturito”, was invented by Chileans and over the past year has grabbed headlines by breaking some of the country’s biggest criminal mysteries.

      <description>We had great fun at the Michiana Mennonite Relief Sale; Bess even bought two baby quilts at auction. I like the Necker Cubist quality of this one she bought.
I especially enjoyed hearing and singing “Dedication Anthem,” by Lowell Mason, often called “606” by Mennonites because that was the page number in the (1969) Mennonite Hymnal.</description>

I already have a 1 Gb USB drive, which is almost enough to carry my work to California and back; I also have a 120 Gb firewire drive that has a bootable copy of my main drive, so, in theory, I don’t need to even bring my laptop at all.</description>

 Driving to church today, Jane (our daughter) had us laughing out loud with her jokes and wordplay. I led worship at church today, and people affirmed that leadership, even though a lot of it has been leading singing a cappella. It looks like I’ll be heading up the ‘worship team’ at church, and like many beginnings, I’m happy thinking about the possibilities of positive change.</description>

      <description>My work brings me to California once a month or so, and, if I can, I sing with the one of the Bay area Sacred Harp groups, usually the Berkeley group, which meets every Monday night. The biggest problem is the longish drive in heavy traffic up to Berkeley on top of a day that starts at 5 am Michigan time. I arrived quite tired, and made many silly mistakes–flubbing even New Britian (Amazing Grace) and calling “Southwell” “Southfield”–a Michigan city, as Mark pointed out.</description>

September eighteenth, nineteen hundred and twenty-six, The people cried mercy in the storm, Their cries were too late their crying was in vain, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.
Chorus: The people cried mercy in the storm, The people cried mercy in the storm, The colored and the white stay’d awake all the night, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.</description>

      <description>Donna Abrahams writes on the Fasola (Sacred Harp) mailing list:
 Judge Jackson himself wrote “Florida Storm.” Many regard it as the quintessential “Colored Sacred Harp” song. It immortalizes a category 4 hurricane known only as Hurricane #6 that hit the Gulf Coast — including southern Florida — in 1926. I kept thinking of the words all during Katrina, which (very sadly) turned out to be about as appropriate today as they were then.</description>

      <description>There has been an interesting discussion about composing on the Sacred Harp mailing list; one of the subtopics has been a perennial favorite: what makes a ‘good’ Sacred Harp tune. One of the desiderata is that parts be interesting to sing as themselves; i.e., a kind of polyphony. I’m curious how one could model ‘interestingness’ computationally. For example, a more varied tune is generally more interesting than a less varied one, so perhaps the variance of interval changes could be a simple model of interestingness.</description>

      <description>An Anglican bishop who is a strong supporter of autocratic President Robert Mugabe has been brought before an ecclesiastical court investigating charges ranging from inciting murder to besmirching the church.

      <description>Jean Véronis got slashdotted on the index size story.
The NCSA is somewhat disclaiming the index size study published on the NCSA website, and the study has been revised somewhat. Véronis is keeping up: his latest post, Technologies du Langage: Yahoo: Missing pages? (4), includes the original stronger disclaimer, and discusses why the revised study is still flawed.
 In conclusion, this new study is just as biaised as the previous one.</description>

 Fighting movies (e.g. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Animation (e.g. The Incredibles), Classicish (e.g. It’s a Wonderful Life), Magic (e.g., Harry Potter), Modern Action (e.g., Charlie’s Angels), Princess Movies (e.g. The Princess Diaries), Movies That I Have No Intention of Watching in the Next Millenium (e.g. 2001, A Space Oddesey).

      <description>Slashdot reported on a NCSA study, A Comparison of the Size of the Yahoo! and Google Indices. On the one hand, they examined actual results returned from the search engines; on the other, they investigated only English searches. The later makes it very unlikely to report a comparison fairly.
Jean Véronis has written a series of posts examining reported results from Google, Yahoo and MSN. One of the latest looks at the claim that Yahoo is indexing 19 billion pages.</description>

      <description>More than mirror neurons? A summary of an study reported in Neuron:
 Most importantly, the study affirms that there really isn’t a single fundamental visual representation in the brain — the representation used to recognize an object is not the same as the representation used to pick up that object. Because of the different functions of these tasks, this probably doesn’t sound too surprising but, to me, it is surprising!</description>

      <description>So, I’m doing what I thought would be a small browser-based project (kindof ‘Ajaxy’), but it turns out to be taking longer than I thought it would. Things are better than there were when I last did heavy web-dev work, especially considering that I am not worrying about being compatible with anything other than the latest FIrefox or Safari releases. But I’m writing a lot of Javascript, and it feels a bit like going back to the mid-80s, and I’m having to remember certain caveats that I haven’t had to thing about in a long time.</description>

      <description>Poor Kalamazoo: It looks like Pfizer is moving some 500 research jobs out of the area (most of these are actually in Portage, the city just to our south). They’re leaving most of the manuafacturing jobs, and animal research in the area, as well as a small research group. Kalamazoo was the world headquarters of the Upjohn Company, which merged with Pharmacia and then swallowed by Pfizer. This doesn’t bode well for Kalamazoo’s long term future.</description>

      <description>Letters to the Editor – April 1973
 That Mr. Dahl’s books have a very powerful effect on children is evident. Kids between 8 and 11 seem to be truly fascinated by them; one of mine used to finish Charlie and then start it right over from the beginning (she was subject to these fits for about two months at age 11). She was like one possessed while reading it, and for a while after reading she was, for a usually amiable child, quite nasty.</description>

      <description>Daughter Jand and I have have finished the new Harry Potter book. I think it’s better written than the last book–tauter, more showing, less telling. Jane thought Rowling made several mistakes, including killing off a major character. It does get fairly dark near the end, as others have noted. This will be a harder book to film, I think. Rowling has a lot to do in the last book to bring out a reasonably happy ending.</description>

 Incidents like this remind us that reporters really do want to do what reporters should do — hammer hypocrisy, discover the facts, and write stories that level with readers. But cowed by bias charges and handcuffed by conventions that keep reporters from calling a lie a lie, all too often they shy away from writing stories that cut through the bull—-.

      <description>It looks like the press is finally putting a little fire on the Whitehouse: read this press briefing by Scott McClellan.
 Q Scott, can I ask you this; did Karl Rove commit a crime? MR. McCLELLAN: Again, David, this is a question relating to an ongoing investigation, and you have my response related to the investigation. And I don’t think you should read anything into it other than we’re going to continue not to comment on it while it’s ongoing.</description>

It’s chiroptera, as you probably already knew. I didn’t know that bats were the most diverse group of mammals (about a quarter of all species) and that they are not that closely related to rodents.

 A Natural Language Voice-Activation feature works by understanding fluent natural language instead of command keywords like ‘RADIO…ON’. For example, ‘TURN UP THE RADIO’ or ‘MAKE THE MUSIC LOUDER’ would all have the same effect. How likely would you be to purchase this feature on your next vehicle at a cost of $300? I wonder who’s asking this?</description>

      <description>I’m pretty sure that this Freakonomics article is in error. Previously, Steven Levitt estimated that the odds are about 10,000 to 1 against being arrested for soliciting in Chicago. But here he marvels at an unlucky patron who was arrested twice in the span of about a week. It was Marilyn vos Savant who pointed out that, although flipping a coin ten times and getting ten heads was as likely as any other permutation, if you did see ten heads in a row, you should be suspicous of the coin.</description>

      <description>I attended the 2005 International Lisp Conference at Stanford, and presented a paper (abstract; the whole thing) on our work at NASA on using Lisp as the substrate of our autonomy software, Apex. I was surprised that the conference lasted for four days. But it made more sense once I arrived: I think people who like Lisp feel somewhat embattled, and this conference is an opportunity to lick wounds and recuperate and not feel the need to justify the use of a nearly 50-year old language.</description>

      <description>Adults can be retrained to learn second languages more easily, says UCL scientist (via Mirabilis.ca). This looks encouraging; still, it’s a small study–the study showed that a study of 63 Japanese ESL students were able to increase their perception of the r/l distinction in English by 18% after 10 sessions. Still, the r/l distinction is notoriously difficult (even native speakers of English end up going for ‘speech therapy’ to learn how to produce the r/l distinction).</description>

      <description>I’ve done an analysis of how frequently hymns from the Denson book were chosen during annual singings in 2004 (as recorded by the Sacred Harp Minutes book).
I tried to be careful to count only selections from Denson. I didn’t look at choices from singings specifically listed as Cooper Book or ‘mixed’ singings. I used a semi-automated process to do the counting.
Perhaps the most interesting difference between the 2002 frequencies is the apparent strong effect of Cold Mountain — 282, I’m Going Home, is was the most chosen tune in 2004.</description>

 A variation on the döner kebab known as a Donair was introduced in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in the early 1970s. A restaurant called The King Of Donairs claims to have been the first to serve this version in 1973. The meat in this version is sliced from a loaf made from a combination of ground beef, flour or bread crumbs, and various spices, while the sauce is made from evaporated milk, sugar, vinegar, and sometimes garlic.</description>

      <description>According to this Salon article:
 On a tape recording made on Feb. 28, 1973, Dean can be heard telling Nixon that Felt was “the only person that knows” details that had been leaked to the Post. Dean later rejected the notion; in an electronic book published by Salon in 2002, he said he didn’t think there was “any way Felt could have been Deep Throat.”

      <description>It appears that the Washington Post is confirming that Mark Felt was Deep Throat. The Watergate hearings and Nixon’s resignation dominated the news the summer between high school and college for me, so Watergate coverage always has a special coming of age tinge for me.
For some reason–probably because I’ve never liked him much–I’m also glad that none of John Dean’s five possible candidates for Deep Throat was Mark Felt.</description>

More evidence that Bush et al. cooked the evidence for WMD in Iraq:
 …Bush said in his Jan. 28, 2003, State of the Union address that Hussein was working to obtain “significant quantities” of uranium from Africa, a conclusion the president attributed to British intelligence and made a key part of his assertion that Iraq had an active nuclear weapons program.More than a year later, the White House retracted the statement after its veracity was questioned.</description>

      <description>I don’t like President Bush much, but he did give a good speech at Calvin: “Remarks by the President at Calvin College Commencement:”
 As the Class of 2005 goes out into the world, I ask you to embrace this tradition of service and help set an example for all Americans. As Americans we share an agenda that calls us to action — a great responsibility to serve and love others, a responsibility that goes back to the greatest commandment.</description>

      <description>I posted this note to the fasola.org mailing list (Sacred Harp singing discussions):
“Holy Manna” is also known as “Brethren we have met to worship.” “New Britian” is the tune to which “Amazing Grace” is usually sung.</description>

Perhaps some, as indicated by the chart above. Click on the chart for a bigger picture. Number of electoral votes accounts for about 16% of variance in job losses.</description>

They pretty much all start ‘Lese sebst:’ followed by a URL.
Anyone else getting these suddenly?
Update I guess it is a worldwide attack, according to the Beeb.</description>

      <description>U.S. security devices at ports to be replaced (via robotwisdom).
 After spending more than $4.5 billion on screening devices to monitor ports, borders, airports, mail and the air, the U.S. government is moving to replace or alter much of the antiterrorism equipment, concluding that it is ineffective, unreliable or too expensive to operate.

      <description>Janis Karpinski has been demoted from brigadier general to colonel. She is the person who was in charge of the Abu Ghraib prison when the scandalous behavior there occurred. Also, the article says:
 The Senate Armed Services Committee has said it intends to hold hearings soon to assess whether senior Defense Department civilian and military leaders were adequately held accountable for Abu Ghraib.This seems an important step.
 Update: She was demoted for shoplifting.</description>

 The impossibility of penetrating the divine scheme of the universe does not, however, dissuade us from planning human schemes, even though we know they must be provisional.

      <description>The NSF just announced the Documenting Endangered Languages project — $4.4 million dollars to document about 70 languages before they go extinct, and, perhaps, to prevent their extinction.
The Ethnologue, probably the single best reference on the demographics of the world’s languages, lists 516 nearly extinct languages., including 170 in the Americas–about 7% of the 6912 ‘living languages’ the Ethnologue describes. They list 73 extinct languages in the USA.</description>

According to my reckoning, that’s over $5,500 for every man, woman and child in Iraq and Afghanistan.</description>

      <description>From a secret Downing Street memo written in July, 2002 (eight months before the war began):
 The Foreign Secretary [Jack Straw] said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.</description>

After 45 minutes or so, Bess took me into the emergency room, where, thanks to the state of American medicine and good health insurance, I left after a couple of hours with a Rhino Rocket up my nose. I look like a booger Borg. I don’t think I’ll be posting pictures.</description>

 Without prejudice to the unified spelling of the name of the single currency of the European Union referred to in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe as displayed on the banknotes and on the coins, Latvia and Hungary declare that the spelling of the name of the single currency, including its derivatives as applied throughout the Latvian and Hungarian text of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, has no effect on the existing rules of the Latvian and the Hungarian languages.</description>

      <description>On advice from Rob Harris, I went to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Unfortunately, I only had about an hour to visit, since the musuem doesn’t open until 11:00 am, and I had a flight out in mid-afternoon. Still, it was a wonderful hour, well spent enjoying the gestalt of the musuem, famously controlled by Gardner’s will to neither add nor subtract from the musuem’s holdings. The courtyard is delightful; it, and the sight of a stained glass window as I turned a corner, both made me gasp.</description>

At the Sacred Harp convention I met Mary McDonald-Lewis, who came down from Washington state to sing. It turns out I’ve heard her voice before–she’s the voice of GM’s OnStar in-car voice recognition system. There’s a great fun MP3 of her demoing her voice on her website at marymac.</description>

      <description>I had a small ‘ah-hah’ experience while reading Implementing sets efficiently in a functional language. Descriptions of binary tree sorting/searching algorithms, such as the excellent Introduction to Algorithms, state that items to be sorted have to be strictly ordered, which means you can’t have duplicates in the tree. But this is easily solved by storing duplicates together in the same binary tree node. “The implementing sets” article suggests adding a ‘count’ field to the node, which marks how many copies are in the node.</description>

It’s interesting to note that the compression ratio went down with the addition of the Bill of Rights. Not surprisingly, the other amendments have the biggest compression ratio There are a number of copies of “The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</description>

      <description>Jean Véronis describes an informal experiment in compressing different texts, including the European constitution. (Original in French, Auto-translated to English). He notes that normally, French texts compress at about 60-65% of the original, but the EU constitution compresses at about 75%. He puts this down to “jargon, puffery, redundancy…” in the constitution. I wonder what the US Constitution is (before and after any admendments added after the Bill of Rights).

      <description>From Archibishop Ncube Urges Mugabe Overthrow
 Although Mugabe is regarded as evil incarnate by Zimbabwe’s Roman Catholic hierarchy, he does have friends elsewhere in the Christian Community. Zimbabwe’s Anglican primate, Bishop Nolbert Kunonga, has used his pulpit at St Mary’s Cathedral in Harare to support Mugabe and his land reform programme.
He was rewarded by Mugabe with one of the farms, St Marnock’s, outside Harare, confiscated from its previous white owner, 25-year-old Marcus Hale.</description>

      <description>Warren Steel, who is at the Department of Music at the University of Mississippi, had access to the original poem, by Edward Young. His “Night Thoughts” was a popular series of poems–Blake illustrated them, for example. Steel wrote on the Sacred Harp mailing list:
 I have a copy of Young’s Night Thoughts handy. Night 4 is the Christian Triumph.

I see the path, and in his death, the price,</description>

      <description>I posted the following questions to the Sacred Harp discussion list. This will be of interest to only those people who are interested in both grammar and Sacred Harp. I may be the only one in this group. However, hope springs eternal …
In Easter Anthem (236), the poetry ends:
Man, all immortal hail,
Hail heaven, all lavish of strange gifts to man,
Thine’s all the glory,
Man’s the boundless bliss.</description>

  Eli Eli lema sabachthani? (Matthew 27:46 and Mark 15:34).

I checked a number of pages, and found that I was feeling a bit sad that nothing I’d written had been worth plagiarizing … until finally I found that my description of C++ in my Real Quick C++ tutorial showed up at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://support.maguma.com/doc/reader.php?docset=sdkdocs&amp;amp;page=oop.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;http://support.maguma.com/doc/reader.php?docset=sdkdocs&amp;amp;page=oop.html&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.

I’ve been asked to “take time to remember the enduring contributions of those Irish-Americans who have given this country … so much,” I’m pretty sure this doesn’t mean I can take off the rest of the month. Did you know that “Nine of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence were Irish-Americans?</description>

      <description>Much fun about teaching English as a foreign language, as I did in a former life; including a bitter essay that pretty much explains why I stopped teaching EFL.
 After the age of 40, English teachers are burnt-out, skill-less and unemployable, their working lives a wasteland, their future oblivion. Suicide attempts are not unheard of. A former colleague of mine, a charming and talented but fatally lazy Scotsman who was well on his way to drinking himself to death, was recently found in a pool of blood, having tried to finish himself off by slashing his wrists.</description>

      <description>We just returned from Montréal. The main purpose was to celebrate the wedding of our niece Margaret Lipsey to Chris Kassab. They’re both chefs, and the wedding was held in a 30’s vintage restuarant, the Lion D’or. Margaret and Chris planned the wedding (Margaret even made marshmallows for the late night chocolate bar), so I took a picture of her behind the coat check.
I also got to visit friend and colleagues Daniel Lemire and Anna MacLaughlin, with whom I worked at the Canadian National Research Council, which was great fun.</description>

      <description>I grew up in Roseville, Michigan, an anonymous Detroit suburb of no distinction. It’s among the least beautiful places I’ve ever seen–the homes are non-descript, the businesses are strip-maill ugly. My father still lives there, so I visit it from time to time. One point of artistic light is a funky little studio run by Ed Stross, who has painted a large mural on the side of his building with portraits of Mother Theresa and Princess Diana.</description>

      <description>Jean Veronis has interesting post about the use of abbreviations in an ancient Christian text. He points out that later (medieval) texts had a much higher use of abbreviations, and suggests that perhaps the use of translations for Lord, Jesus, etc., were to mark “membership in a tribe” in addition to compression.
 Ne retrouve-t-on pas là le double besoin qui se fait sentir dans l’écriture “texto” : gagner de la place, sans doute, mais aussi marquer son appartenance à une tribu, à un groupe à part ?</description>

No Britneys before the 1970s, or Khalils before the 1980s. (The chart only has data for the 1000 most popular names per decade).</description>

      <description>Yet Another Cell Phone Distraction Study. Study size: 20. Findings: talking on a cell phone is distracting; young people react with the slowness of older/drunken people; old people react with the slowness of slightly older people. Six of the 20 rear-ended the (simulated) pace car (four while talking on a cell phone).
 “If you put a 20-year-old driver behind the wheel with a cell phone, their reaction times are the same as a 70-year-old driver who is not using a cell phone.</description>

It’s hard to know how to prepare a 12 year old for the math section of the SATs, but today we spent about an hour discussing odds and percentages.</description>

      <description>From: Do You Speak American / Sea to Shining Sea / American Varieties / Midwest:
 Indeed, it is not uncommon to find Michiganders who will claim that the speech of national broadcasters is modeled on their dialect. Even a cursory comparison of the speech of the network news anchors with that of the local news anchors in Detroit will reveal the fallacy of such claims.and
  As long as Midwesterners are viewed as average, boring or otherwise nondescript, their speech will be seen through the same prism.</description>

      <description>From the New York Times review of ‘The Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker’ by Walter Kern:
 [O]ne does sense that the cartoons have done the job they first set out to do: purging any lingering puritanism from their relatively well-heeled audience and replacing it with a smart-aleck self-awareness that suddenly — just look around — feels useless, lonely and crippling.

      <description>Every year I attempt to update our address list, especially in order to send out Christmas cards. The original database of addresses I created is gone; I can’t remember what I originally used. Last year was too choatic to do anything. This year I decided to create the list from scratch. In fact, I decided I would just write out addresses in an address book.
In the end, though, I had a brainstorm.</description>

      <description>The New Yorker has a somewhat amusing application form for disgruntled Democrats who want to move to Canada, which includes this question:
 Translate the following statement: “Cripes, grade thirteen! Here’s a loonie — buy a Coffee Crisp, eh?”Geoff Pullum can’t make heads or tails of it. But (having been a Canadian resident for several weeks and author of The Canadian Quiz, I think I’m on the case:

      <description>I remembered a post by Mark Liberman about disambiguation of complex nominals when I visited a doughnut shop today. The post points out that, when trying to determine automatically whether a phrase like “sickle cell anemia” is (say) sickle-type cell anemia or an anemia of sickle cells — i.e., whether it’s [sickle] [cell anemia] or [sickle cell] [anemia]–you can do something very simple, which works very well in practice: count the number of times “sickle cell” and “cell anemia” occur in a large body of texts, and the more frequent is likely to be the right grouping.</description>

      <description>Michigan went for Gore in 2000, and for Kerry in 2004, by relatively small amounts: Gore got 51.3% of the vote in 2000 (with 2.6% going to 3rd parties). Kerry got 51.1% of the vote in 2004 (with 1% going to third parties).
Voting was up 13.7% over 2000. Most interesting is the disparity between Democrats and Republicans: Democratic voters were up 13.3%, but Republicans were up 18.1%.
It’s interesting to pull out two counties: my own (Kalamazoo) and Wexford, a largely rural county in northern lower Michigan (the county seat is Cadillac, where my sister-in-law Jean and her family just moved–and she immediately jumped into the Democratic get out the vote).</description>

      <description>My projections: Kerry: 320, Bush: 218 electoral votes. Also, although there might be some question about some states’ final votes, I predict the differences will be large enough that we’ll know pretty well by tomorrow morning.

      <description>I voted in Kalamazoo, Michigan; our district uses optical scanners. I arrived around 7:30 am. I vote at the school my daughter attends, and I walked her down. The line was quite long — it was cool and a bit drizzly, but I didn’t sense that people were leaving. I got out at 8:40. I noticed that I was the 101st voter; the previous voter was right ahead of me. So, with the polls opening at 7:00, this means they were handling about 1 voter per minute.</description>

      <description>This election is for them (picture of a white soldier, a white mother and child). DON’T LET THEM DOWN! Strong defense and security, a commitment to protecting America, to protecting or families–Our President, our Commander in Chief George W. Bush is the strong and steady leader we need. Without your vote, he’ll be forced to step down and surrender his position to an upredictable and risky candidate with a completely different set of priorities for America.</description>

      <description>Geoff Pullum has a great anti-Struck and White rant, which he says is:
 a horrid little compendium of unmotivated prejudices (don’t use ongoing), arbitrary stipulations (don’t begin a sentence with however), and fatuous advice (“Be clear”), ridiculously out of date in its positions on appropriate choices among grammatical variants, deeply suspect in its style advice and grotesquely wrong in most of the grammatical advice it gives.
Struck and White was (I think) the first book on writing style I ever read, and I fell in love–mostly, I think, because of White’s introductory essay.</description>

      <description>[The senior Whitehouse aide] told me something that at the time I didn’t fully comprehend — but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.
The aide said that guys like me were ”in what we call the reality-based community,” which he defined as people who ”believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.” I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism.</description>

      <description>Tim Bray recommends:
 If you’re running a company and there’s a general perception that your CEO is [an expletive for fool], eventually it won’t matter that much whether he really is or isn’t; the perception will become an obstacle. And right now, the United States of America is facing that obstacle.

      <description>People always want “knock-out blows” in a debate, but there weren’t any, of course. Bush usually sounded less desparate than he did in the first two debates; he always seems more intelligent when he’s calm. Kerry’s performance was exactly the same as in the first two debates: “presidential,” in a word. CBS’s instant poll of undecideds said a plurality thought Kerry had won the debate.
I could be wrong, but I think this debate shows that the right’s use of “liberal” as a scare word is dying.</description>

      <description>Watching this debate, I found myself much more interested in the horserace–who was winning? who was losing? It seemed clear to me that the President was on the defensive; he even sounded desparate to me (although he seemed to calm down during the last 20 minutes or so). Kerry seemed, well, presidential and wise. Both candidates wandered off a little too often and a little too far from the questions they were asked–but this is a problem that’s bothered me for 30 years or so.</description>

      <description>A followup on post about searching for ‘vice presidential debate’, which Tim commented on.
First of all, I really wasn’t complaining about (say) Yahoo Search’s lack of results from the 2004 debates–it was just odd and a bit disorienting to be thrown back to 2000. I even clicked on an audio stream of the debate and got a ‘this stream is no longer available’ error message–it was then that I realized this was a link for the 2000 Lieberman-Cheney debate.</description>

      <description>Gwen Ifill asked Edwards, “What qualifies you to be a heartbeat away?” Cheney’s follow-up was interesting:
 FILL: Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds.
CHENEY: You want me to answer a question about his qualifications?
IFILL: That was the question.
CHENEY: I see.
Well, I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president. Different presidents approach it in different ways.
When George Bush asked me to sign on, it obviously wasn’t because he was worried about carrying Wyoming.</description>

      <description>It’s interesting that as I’ve searched for sources for the vice presidential debates tonight, I’m getting a lot of hits from the debates (both presidential and vice presidential) from 2000. I guess this has to do with “page rank,” but it seems odd. This CNN link, for example, was the fifth link on Google for ‘vice presidential debate. Four out of the top five results for ‘vice presidential debate’ from the beta search engine snap, as well as Yahoo search were from the 2000 election.</description>

      <description>Initial reactions: Today, I’m optimistic about America. Our local paper reports that about 96% of Michigan residents who could register to vote, have registered to vote. It’s clear that this election has stirred interests in and emotions about the political life of our country in ways that haven’t happened in a long time. The candidates were clearly different (as in the first presidential debate) and each gave a ‘very good and forceful presentation of themselves’ (as I just heard on the radio).</description>

      <description>According to Bruce Schneier, the Bush adminstration wants to put RFID tags in our passports.
 Unfortunately, there is only one possible reason: The administration wants surreptitious access [to the broadcast information on the passports] themselves. It wants to be able to identify people in crowds. It wants to surreptitiously pick out the Americans, and pick out the foreigners. It wants to do the very thing that it insists, despite demonstrations to the contrary, can’t be done.</description>

      <description>Bush was well-briefed, articulate and scowling. Kerry was well-briefed, articulate and, well, presidential. The debate centered, justifiably, on the war in Iraq, although Bush kept wanting to make it a debate on who is more steadfast. Kerry didn’t quite make the point he should be: that, when you make a mistake, it’s muleish to be maintain the same path. Bush hammered on the “steadfastness” theme:
 “People know where I stand.</description>

      <description>I was at a bookstore yesterday, and came across an American slang dictionary. “Flub the dub” was included, meaning to make a mistake. Google gives more results, including translations of American slang into Korean and Russian.
Via Yahoo Search: Flub-a-dub was a cast member on Howdy Doody. Flubadubya is a screen name on the Democratic Underground. And, finally, it even shows up in the Bible.</description>

      <description>I was listening to Johnny Cash’s version of “In the Jailhouse Now,” which has the line:
 Well Old Bill really flubbed his dub when he wore a tuxedo to the country club. I did a quick search for “flubbed his dub” on Google, and only this Hindu Unity rant came back. You can find “flub your dub” a couple of times, including this bluegrass song. I assume that ‘flub (your) dub” means make a big mistake; but how did this Southernism get to India?</description>

      <description>An An by Mark Liberman on the current political discourse, which centers on impossible to recall events of decades ago instead of the real issues:
 We have free speech in this country, and access to a magnificently flexible and expressive language. This power of linguistic expression, granted to our species alone it would seem, is strong magic. We must be very careful what we do with it. This descent into slander and false memory recovery and document forgery and history denial and mutual accusations of cowardice and treachery is not the free discussion of political matters that the authors of the First Amendment envisaged for us.</description>

      <title>Duelfer report on WMD</title>

      <description>On Thursday, the US briefed reporters on a draft report on the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Although it states that Iraq clearly intended to produce WMD at some point, no significant evidence of WMDs have been found. This is very significant because:
  The US went to war in Iraq citing the immediate danger of Iraq’s WMD program.
  The UN inspection program in Iraq argued that WMDs were very unlikely.</description>

      <title>Nader in Kalamazoo</title>

      <description>Ralph Nader visited Kalamazoo today. Among other things, he tolld the audience (according to the Kalamazoo Gazette article) to”vote your conscience.” And, in general, this seems like a reasonable thing to say. But, of course, Nader is only on the ballot in Michigan because the Republican Party passed out petitions for him, because they hope (and not unreasonably so) that this will draw votes away from Kerry. My conscience says not to vote for people who cannot attract enough workers to get on the ballot.</description>

      <description>OK, I lost the computer that I usually kept my weblog postings on, so maybe it makes sense to return to one of the free weblogging services. So, here I am back at Blogger. Yes, it isboring to read about changing weblogging servers, but it’s difficult to write something interesting, just to have it disappear into bitlandia.</description>
