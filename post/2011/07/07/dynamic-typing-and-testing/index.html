This is just a few thoughts about what it was like to write tests for this code, which can be found at [<a href="https://github.com/willf/inverted_index_simple">https://github.com/willf/inverted_index_simple</a>]<a href="https://github.com/willf/inverted_index_simple">1</a>–not that I think you’ll write the next major search engine with this bit of code…</p>
<p>What struck me was that as I was writing unit tests, how many of the tests failed at first either because of undefined variables or dynamic typing problems. For example, in the method query_and (which returns the set intersection of all documents containing query terms), I originally wrote:</p>
<p><code>def query_and tokens return Set.new if tokens.size == 0 sets = tokens.map{|token| query_token token} sets[1..-1].inject(sets[0]){|reduction, x| &lt;strong&gt;redution&lt;/strong&gt; &amp; x} end</code></p>
<p>The third line is only tested if there are at least three query terms, so it was important to write such a test. But what surprised me is that the error was not in the logic, but the literal typing–I misspelled “reduction” the second time.</p>
<p>Similarly, I think I wrote a version of the function that had</p>
<p>sets = tokens.map{|token| query_token <strong>tokens</strong>}</p>
<p>where I typed ‘tokens’ instead of ‘token’ by mistake.</p>
<p>With a statically typed language, neither of these errors are likely to make it past the static compiler. The Go language, for example, won’t even let you declare variables unless you use them–something which drives me mad, but is probably the right thing to do. (It would have caught the second error, even if ‘token’ and ‘tokens’ happened to be of the same type.)</p>
<p>The great loss of strict static typing comes when it is difficult to write ‘generic’ code (stacks, and queues, for example, of anything); most modern languages provide some sort of facility for this (and we’re still waiting for Go to provide this). The other great loss is when it really makes sense to have union types: functions that work on lists of ints, in addition to ints.</p>
