<blockquote>
<p>NEW YORK – The results of an internal Justice Department investigation released today reveal that officials at the highest level of government — including the White House — received reports on the abuse of prisoners in U.S. military custody overseas as early as 2002. Congress called on the department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to conduct the investigation after documents made public through an American Civil Liberties Union Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request revealed FBI agents at Guantánamo had raised concerns about methods used by military interrogators. Today’s government report is the first to identify that then-National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice received complaints of torture.
More later, perhaps.</p>
