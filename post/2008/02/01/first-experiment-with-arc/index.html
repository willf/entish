<p>One thing I’ve liked about using Ruby is a testing framework called Rspec, in which you describe the behavior of your program in a kind of narrative form. So I decided to try and write a similar system for Arc.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a specification that tests three of Arc’s list operations. The last specification will fail in this example. WordPress is going to screw up indentation; there’s not much to be done about it.</p>

<p>The result is either ‘red’ (at least one test failed) or ‘green’ (all tests passed).</p>
<p>Each ‘it’ clause is a specification test; and optional clauses allow you to specify a ‘prolog’ to run before all the tests, an ‘epilog’ to run after, and setup and teardown clauses to run before and after each test. As a simple example:</p>

<p>Things I liked about writing this program and Arc in general:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s very nice to have real macros again, not Ruby’s sort-of macroish text re-evaluation.</li>
<li>To collect all of the <code>it</code> clauses, I wrote a function called <code>assocs``, and I liked the way Arc allows you to write anonymous functions. Here's the definition:&lt;br&gt;``(def assocs (key list) (keep [and (acons _) (is (car _) key)] list))</code><br>
The anonymous function is between the square brackets.</li>
<li>I think I could come to like the short names Graham has chosen.</li>
<li>I like to imagine that this is one of the first Arc programs not written by Graham or Morris.</li>
<li>Although I didn’t write it, it would be trivial to add HTML output as a different format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some things that Arc really does need and I missed in writing this code:</p>
<ol>
<li>A standard structure object (and vectors). Over half my code is spent in writing list accessors. Fortunately, these are easy to write.</li>
<li>Error objects and error handling! It’s hard to believe there is none yet.</li>
<li>The usual code writing things: tracing, edit modes, unit testing tools — oh, wait, I just wrote that.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t know how successful Arc will be. Certainly it will need lots of standard libraries, pervasive Unicode string handling, etc., if it is to move beyond it’s current state (and to Graham’s credit, he’s not claiming any more for ‘Arc0’ than is there). But it is nice to be able to program in a Lisp again.</p><ul class="pa0">
