<p>I think it was shameful, scandalous and grossly stupid that our Governor Granholm, Senator Levin, and the state Democratic and Republican committees disenfranchised Michigan voters.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars were spent holding a sham election in which the only Democratic front-runner on the ticket was Senator Clinton. Her presence on the ballot was itself a masterful bit of triangulation, allowing her to garner votes while not spending any money on campaigning in Michigan and publicly committing to honor the Democratic National Committee’s rules.</p>
<p>The only reasonable course is for Michigan to split its delegates evenly between Senators Obama and Clinton. This at least gets Michigan representation at the national convention, is cost-free, and would roughly represent the opinions of Michigan voters (although I don’t know of any polling to support that).</p>
<p>My biggest fear is that Clinton will win the nomination via back-room negotiations using Michigan’s ‘super-delegates’ claiming to represent Michigan; this will be bad for Michigan and bad for the nation. If Granholm deserts the state to join Clinton’s cabinet, I will be very disappointed, and our poor state will suffer even more economic and political hardship.</p>
<p>I still stand by my prediction that Clinton will win the nomination and the election, although this is not an outcome I want. When will a real alternative to the Democrats and Republicans appear?</p>
