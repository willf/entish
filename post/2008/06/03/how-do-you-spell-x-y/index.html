<p>I came across an earlier example from 1793, in Elder John Leland’s “The history of Jack Nips”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like other boys, I wished to be in fashion, and as the Presbyterians were the most fashionable, I applied myself to the study of their books, but was not a little puzzled to reconcile their writings with my boyish thoughts. I could not, for my gizzard, understand their orthography, until I was more than sixteen. They would spell thus: c-i-r, cir, c-u-m, cum, c-i, ci, s-e-d, <em>baptism</em>.
(The full tract can be found <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/1668/HistoryJackNips.html">here</a>, but beware the cheesy embedded sound file).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite the same thing is found in Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing. Ursula and Hero are discussing Beatrice, and Hero says:</p>
<p>I never yet saw man, How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured, But she would spell him backward. ( <a href="http://www.rhymezone.com/r/gwic.cgi?Path=shakespeare/comedies/muchadoaboutnothing/iii_i//&amp;Word=but+she+would+spell+him+backward:+if+fair-faced,#w">Much Ado About Nothing, 3.1</a>)</p>
<p>Wikipedia says it was first published in <a href="http://www.powerset.com/explore/semhtml/Much_Ado_About_Nothing">1600</a>. But I still think Leland’s turn is different enough to consider it separately. Was Leland the first person to use the spelling of a word to stand for a quality of a different concept all together?</p>
