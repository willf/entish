<p>Arnold Zwicky has a post at Language Log on <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=289">“home” vs. “house” in (American) English</a>, citing (among other things) the commentators in the Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A final note on home ownership: MWDEU reports that “a number of commentators have remarked on the tendency to buy a home and sell a house”.
I was curious to see whether this ‘tendency’ was real, so I checked the Google 3-gram data (see <a href="http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/08/all-our-n-gram-are-belong-to-you.html">announcement</a>). I think for this tendency to be real, the following should be true:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(1) buy a home &raquo; buy a house (2) sell a house &raquo; sell a home (3) (buy a home/buy a house) &raquo; (sell a home/sell a house)</p>
<p>Here are the bare facts:</p>
<p>buy a home : 328,584 buy a house: 235,019 sell a home: 193,088 sell a house: 25,632</p>
<p>and the ratios:</p>
<p>buy a home/buy a house: 1.40 sell a home/sell a house: 7.53 buy/sell ratio of ratios 0.19 (buy a home+sell a home)/(buy a house+sell a house): 2.00</p>
<p>As you can see, (1) is true, but (2) and (3) are not (2 and 3 are related, of course). According to the Google data, ‘home’ is twice is likely than ‘house’ in both these contexts, and ‘sell a home/sell a house’ is much greater than the ‘buy a home/buy a house’ ratio.</p>
<p>It must be all those realtors (oh, excuse me, ‘REALTOR®s’).</p>
