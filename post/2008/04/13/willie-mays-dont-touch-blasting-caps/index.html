 You protect your arms and hands legs and save your eyes. If you see a blasting cap remember now, don’t touch them. Tell a police or a fireman or whatever it is.

Anyone I’ve ever met who is exactly my age in years and grew up near Detroit remembers this with fear. I’ve often wondered who produced it. It was sponsored by the “<a href="http://ime.org">Institute of Makers of Explosives</a>,” which has a lovely website as well as the killer tagline: “Explosives make it possible.”</p>
