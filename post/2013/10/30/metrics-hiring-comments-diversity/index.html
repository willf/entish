In it, he does something I haven’t seen anyone else do, which is to dive into his own data looking for indicators of success of people he has hired. He found that <em>referral quality</em> and <em>school quality</em> were the two most predictive indicators. Lukas does not break down his data by gender or age or other demographic classes. I have to say, I very much appreciate Lukas’s humility in recognizing that he’d made disastrous hiring decisions.

<p>I responded briefly (of course) on Twitter, as did Tim Converse. Here’s our conversation — <a href="https://twitter.com/l2k/status/395250560963596288">three white guys shooting the breeze</a>. I think Tim and I both were trying to bring in a warning about the cost of limiting diversity, which was what Lukas seemed to be taking from his data (that is, he did better when he hired from his old boy networks). Both Tim and I have written essays about the cost of limiting diversity <a href="http://timconverse.wordpress.com/2006/10/29/hiring-false-negatives-in-the-bigcorp/">(Tim’s essay</a>, <a href="http://www.entish.org/published/aighosts.pdf">my essay</a>).</p>
<p>The lesson I take away from Lukas’s essay is the importance of really understanding how people get referred into an organization. How do you make the move from hiring just from within your own networks and hiring more broadly while still hiring strong candidates? One answer might be some kind of moneyball approach, based on what candidates have actually delivered in the past. Another answer is active and strong mentoring programs to both find diverse candidates and build culture together (for example, what <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3005681/how-hack-broken-gender-dynamics-workplace">Etsy did with their hacker school</a>).</p>
<p>I suspect that diversity has to be built into a startup from its earliest days. If it is part of the culture to find and retain excellent people who are not like themselves, then the advantages of a diverse workplace will scale as the company grows. I’m not suggesting that this is easy, but I do believe it is both necessary and feasible.</p>
