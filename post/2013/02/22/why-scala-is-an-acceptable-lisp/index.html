<p>Wordnik made the transition from Java to Scala before I joined them, and at least in my early days there, it seemed like the question was “Why Scala is a better Java.” For example, Tony Tam (the current CEO, but “A CEO who codes” and the chef overseeing the preparation of our particular technological stew), said that Scala’s <em>traits</em> were a big win for Wordnik (see <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/2/15/wordnik-10-million-api-requests-a-day-on-mongodb-and-scala.html">this report</a>, for example). Traits are an improvement over Java’s interfaces, but not an especially new way of looking at programming.</p>
<p>Scala isn’t as Lisp-like as Clojure, nor is it as pure as Haskell. A lot of work has been done to make Scala more like Haskell, both in the language itself as well as third-party libraries such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scalaz/">scalaz</a>. But, as I have been writing Scala code, especially on a recent series of projects, I’ve come to realize that many of the things that I liked about programming in Lisp are present in Scala, even without going into the deeper ends of <a href="http://www.jasq.org/2/post/2013/01/the-mathematician-the-monoid.html">Monads, Monoids and Applicatives</a>.</p>
<p>As three examples, consider collections, recursion, and functional counters.</p>
<p><em>Collections</em>. Most of the code I write seems to work over collections of various types, and the Scala <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.package">collection</a> is well-thought out. It provides the real workhorses of functional programing (map, flatMap, filter, fold, reduce, take, drop, zip). And the chaining syntax is, I would argue, an improvement over Common Lisp’s s-expressions (so much so that Clojure provides it as well). As a random snippet of code, consider this from something I’m working on right now (similar returns an iterable set of Tuples which contain an object and a score):</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recursion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I was talking to Stew O’Connor about a particular mess of code I had created, and I was trying to simplify it (there was a hairy fold operation, if I recall, and the line count for the function itself was way too high). His wise suggestion was that I use recursion for what I was doing — I palmfaced myself and told him that they were going to take away my Lisp coder’s card. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I write a lot of code that looks like this:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>(I apologize for that <em>null</em>; this is a case where I’m using a Java library — the wonderful <a href="http://jsoup.org/">Jsoup</a> — and it retains its Javaness even when called from Scala). This feels very Lisp-like to me.</p>
<p><em>Functional counters</em>. I really only mention this because it’s described in Paul Graham’s original essay — how to write a function that generates accumulators; that is, a function (with parameter <em>n</em>) returning a function which, on each invocation, returns the <em>next</em> value of <em>n</em>. To be able to do this, of course, a language needs to support functions as first-level objects.  As Graham points out, this is easy in Lisp:</p>

<p>And it’s not too difficult in Scala:</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Scala has many other virtues, even if it at times is hampered by its syntax. Scala 2.10 added Lisp-like macros, and I look forward to exploring them, even as I dread what that will be like for a messy language like Scala. But it is its basic functional aspect that I currently like the most. I’m even gaining an appreciation for strong typing.</p>
