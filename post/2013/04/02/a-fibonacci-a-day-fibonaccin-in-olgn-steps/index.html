The code below might not make much sense without looking at the SICP chapter or his explanation, but here is the code in Scala, and put in the form that I’ve been using — this computes fibonacci(n) for any integer (including negative integers). Running the benchmark indicates that this version a lot faster than the straight tail recursive version.</p>
