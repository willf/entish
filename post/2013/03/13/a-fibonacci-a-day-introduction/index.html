<p>The Fibonacci function is a function which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. It’s kind of a famous function in computer science when people are first learning about recursive functions. It’s sometimes used as a kind of FizzBuzz test — a programmer ought to be able to write the Fibonacci function quickly. But there are lots of things that are going on even with something as simple as the Fibonacci function, and I’d like to explore these for a while in a series that I’ll call “A Fibonacci A Day” (with a nod to Erin McKean’s <a href="http://www.dressaday.com/">A Dress A Day</a>, only with more programming and less stylistic flair).</p>
<p>All the programming will be in Scala, and code will be in a GitHub repository, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fibonacci-a-day<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Tomorrow, we’ll start with perhaps the most famous version, the naive recursive algorithm.</p>
