I especially like his clear description on what monoids and endomorphisms are. I suspect the main point of his article is to describe these things, and how them might be useful, and I think he succeeds, at least in the first part.</p>
<p>However, his approach is not one I would take, in the spirit of <a href="http://willwhim.wpengine.com/2013/02/22/why-scala-is-an-acceptable-lisp/">Why Scala is an acceptable Lisp</a>.</p>
<p>The task is to compute a total salary, given a configuration object and a base salary, according to the following algorithm (from the original post):</p>
<ol>
<li>basic = the basic component of his salary</li>
<li>allowances = 20% of basic</li>
<li>bonus = 10% of (basic + allowances)</li>
<li>tax = 30% of (basic + allowances + bonus)</li>
<li>surcharge = 10% of (basic + allowances + bonus – tax)</li>
</ol>
<p>The configuration object holds whether an allowance, a bonus, tax, or surcharges are to be supplied. Ghosh points out that this is essentially a “composition of functions,” except that the configuration object gets in the way (that is, it is a function from Config × Salary → Salary, rather than just Salary → Salary).</p>
<p>The first (strawman) version Ghosh writes is a strictly imperative one — a <strong>var</strong> is created and mutated based on the configuration. This is Bad because of the mutation. But, I would claim, it has one real advantage over Ghosh’s code: all of the “business logic” is put in one place, which includes the ordering and the amounts.</p>
<p>But we can be completely functional and still keep all of the business logic together. In the following code, the rules are just a sequence of Symbol, Double tuples that express how much to add or deduct, and, equally importantly, the order in which to calculate. If a configuration is simply a Set of those same symbols, then calculating the salary is a simple fold operation (<a href="https://gist.github.com/willf/5083611">on GitHub</a>):</p>

<p>I’d claim the following advantages over Ghosh’s version:</p>
<ol>
<li>The rules are in <strong>data</strong>, not in <strong>code</strong>.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>The ordering is expressed by the Seq and the foldLeft operations</li>
<li>Simple data structures are used (entities are not multiplied beyond necessity)</li>
<li>It is much easier to read (and debug)</li>
