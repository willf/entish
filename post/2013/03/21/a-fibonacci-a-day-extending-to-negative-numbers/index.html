<p>I haven’t been happy, though, with returning a negative -1 when the function is called with a negative number — this feels like a kind of silent error we were trying to avoid in going to BigInts. Fortunately, it turns out that there is a natural extension of the Fibonacci sequence to negative numbers. If the nth Fibonacci number is defined as F(n) = F(n-2) + F(n-1), then we can rearrange this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">F(-n) = (-1)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->F(n)</a>.</p>
<p>So, this is the final version of the Fibonacci function, that supports any integer, up to the the memory size of the computer, computed quite quickly. Much better than our simple recursive or iterative version, which were ripe for error and inefficiency.</p>
