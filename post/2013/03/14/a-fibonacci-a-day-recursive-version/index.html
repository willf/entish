<p>The definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:</p>
<p>F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)</p>
<p>This naturally leads to the following recursive function (here, as in all of the versions of A Fibonacci A Day, in Scala):</p>

<p>Note that because we are in the world of Scala, we have to declare that we are writing a function on Ints (that is, the Java/Scala representation of 32-bit signed numbers).</p>
<p>This function is simple, elegant, and fundamentally flawed. The first flaw we’ll look at today is how costly it is to compute. At some <em>n</em>, the function will make 2 recursive calls, which will each make 2 recursive calls, which will each make 2 recursive calls until it reaches 0 or 1. In other words, it will take approximately 2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted --> calls to find a result. For example, fibonacci(46) will make over 35 trillion calls (why 46? we’ll discuss this in a later post). Assuming enough memory, and making 10k calls per second, this would still take over a hundred years to finish.</p>
<p>So, perhaps the simple and elegant way is not the right way. By the end of this series, we will have something that is fast enough, and still simple and elegant.</p>
