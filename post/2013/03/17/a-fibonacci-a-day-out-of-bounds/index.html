<p>As it turns out, Scala’s Int and Long types are always <em>signed</em>, and do silent overflow. Once the number gets to a certain size, adding more will turn it ‘negative,’ and adding even more will eventually turn it positive, but (of course) the number is not correct. Nothing in the Scala type system prevents this. The Int version of the fibonacci function is good up to 46, the Long version is good up to about 164, and a Double version up to about 1476.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Scala provides a BigInt that will grow as big as memory available, so we can simply rewrite the iterative version to use BigInts.</p>
<p>The other, minor problem, is that we don’t handle the case of passing negative numbers to our fibonacci function — this is not defined (at least as we described it informally). We can either ‘throw an error,’ or return a negative number to indicate the number is out of domain.</p>
<p>Here’s the revised, BigInt version.</p>
