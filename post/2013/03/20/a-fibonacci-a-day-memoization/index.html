<p>Although the iterative recursive version is stateless, it looks different from the standard mathematical definition. The <a href="http://willwhim.wpengine.com/2013/03/14/a-fibonacci-a-day-recursive-version/" title="A Fibonacci A Day — Recursive version">recursive version</a> is a very close mapping, but it’s extremely inefficient. One way to overcome the inefficiencies is to dynamically record (or <em>memoize</em>) previous calculations of F(<em>n</em>). The idea is simple — if we already know the values of F(<em>n</em> – 1) and F(<em>n</em> – 2), we can simply add them without having to do the difficult steps in recreating them.
__</p>
<p>Here is a version that does just that —</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Note that a memoization table is defined <em>outside</em> the scope of the function, and an internal function, <em>fib</em> looks for a memoized value in the table. If it finds it, it simply returns it; if it doesn’t, it makes a recursive call to the outer fibonacci function. Consider F(2). It looks up F(1), which is not yet in the table, so it calls the outer fibonacci function with 1. That returns BigInt(1), which is stored in the table and returned. It does a similar thing with F(0). It now knows enough to calculate the results, which it returns.</p>
<p>The main body of this function looks very similar to the mathematical definition. But there are two disadvantages to this version. One is that we still have mutable state (the memoization table). A clever, if somewhat convoluted way, to overcome this is to use a State monad —Tony Morris describes how to do this in his article,  <a href="http://blog.tmorris.net/posts/memoisation-with-state-using-scala">Memoization WIth State Using Scala.</a> Another problem is this is somewhat less predictable — calling F(2000) out of the gate is likely to fail (with too many stack calls) unless most of the intermediate values are already calculated. That is, <strong>fibonacci_8(2000)</strong> will probably fail, but <strong>for (i ← 1 to 2000) fibonacci_8(n)</strong> might not. I have more problems with the second issue than the second —</p>
<p>Side note: English already had a word for remembering things by rote, <em>memorization,</em> and a technical term, <em>cacheing</em> as well. Why did <em>memoization</em> seem necessary?</p>
