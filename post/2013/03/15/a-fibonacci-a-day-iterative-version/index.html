Recursive functions typically break down a problem into smaller pieces, solve the smaller pieces, then combine the results into a final result, where “breaking down” a problem is done by the recursive function calling itself on a smaller version of itself. But, as we saw, it’s possible that the number of times this may happen has to be controlled, or gross inefficiencies may occur; this sometimes gives recursion a bad name.</p>
<p>The classic approach to writing the Fibonacci function is to write it <em>iteratively</em>, that is, to manually manage the building up of a solution. We note that if we keep two counters running, one for <em>n-2</em> and one for <em>n-1</em>, we can collect the total easily enough.

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As in the recursive version, we handle the base cases (0 and 1) directly, but from then on, we go from 2 to n (technically, from 1 to <em>n-1</em>) collecting a total in <em>t</em>, and using two accumulators, <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> for prior results.</p>
<p>The running time of the iterative version is O(<em>n</em>), that is, it will calculate the _n_th Fibonacci number in about <em>n</em>  steps. This is clear from direct inspection of the <strong>for</strong> loop.</p>
<p>This algorithm still has problems, as a piece of software, which we’ll discuss in the next installment. What happens, for example, when it calculates the Fibonacci number of 1000?</p>
