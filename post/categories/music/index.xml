      <description>This weekend my good friend Samuel Sommers and I traveled south to sing shape note music. It’s Sam’s usual practice to go south on the first Sunday in May and the Saturday before to sing in Huntsville, Alabama on the Saturday and then in Dutton, Alabama for the Dedication Sunday at Shady Grove church, and he graciously invited me along.
The massive storms and numerous tornadoes that hit Alabama changed our plans.</description>

      <description>I just noticed that Richard Stoddard posted a recording of my leading Few Happy Matches at Camp Fasola in 2009 (the recording was done by Al McCready). This is a tune I had been leading a lot at Sacred Harp singings and conventions in 2009; I still like it. One silly reason is that the tune’s title indicates a goal of a good search engine. The title actually comes from an Isaac Watts poem about the difficulty of good marriage matches, according to Warren Steele.</description>

      <description>At nearly the last minute, Tom Malone suggested that we drive down to Camp Fasola on the Sunday before Camp began in the evening, and return on Thursday, the last day of Camp. I had to work on Friday (“Work—the curse of the singing class,” quipped Richard Schmeidler at dinner one day), and Tom is in the midst of a move back east. So, it was convenient to do this—as if driving 13 hours one way is anyone’s idea of ‘convenient.</description>

      <description>A response to R Dean Hudgens’s Tongues and Tribes: Musical Change in a Mennonite Congregation.
I am very, very grateful for the time I spent at Reba Place Church (1990-1996, 1998 or so), and loved the music there. I was very grateful for the intentional way that the call to anti-racism worked itself out in music and worship. This included being part of the gospel choir, which developed my spirit and my musical abilities and helped me on an anti-racist path.</description>

And that’s just to get to Juneau! I guess I won’t be going to Sitka. Unless Sarah Palin is offering rides.</description>

      <description>Besides what must be a playful reference to a fake invention, the “Sacred Harp of Eloquence,” and a brief mention in a letter to the editor, the first mention of the Sacred Harp in the New York Times comes in a review of Eleanor de al Vergne Risley’s “The Road to Wildcat: A Tale of Southern Mountaineering,” a memoir of her travels; the reviewer says she went to the ‘Appalachian foothills of Alabama and then went on to the mountain country.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed the Golden Gate Sacred Harp Singing this past week in San Francisco, and even managed to record the afternoon session (not a great recording, but not terrible either; the altos were strong, but perhaps not as strong as they sound in the recording). The singing was chaired by Natalia Cecire, who is working on a PhD in English at U.C. Berkeley.
I found a great quotation, by the way, in Natalia’s draft of a MLA presentation she gave, “From Stone Tablet to Pensieve: Media and History in Children’s Fantasy“:</description>

      <description>Here’s a labor of love: the Harmonia Sacra online.
The Harmonia Sacra is a shape-note tunebook in the Mennonite tradition. Originally published in 1832 by Joseph Funk as A Compilation of Genuine Church Music, it has gone through twenty-six editions. This on-line version provides both seven-shape and four-shape (“Sacred Harp”-style) versions of tunes.
I created a website (static website, but generated with Ruby) using James Nelson Gingerich’s excellent newly typeset versions of this tune book.</description>

      <description>The kind people at Blessed Hope Old Regular Baptist Church in Liberty Kentucky have been making their worship services available online, including lots of ‘lined out’ hymns. The general website is at ‘Blessed Hope Services‘. One very nice hymn is ‘Beside the gospel pool’ (mp3). I love how you can often hear the children in the background.</description>

      <description>Jonathan Coulton is “a musician, a singer-songwriter and an internet superstar.” He wrote a sweet, goopy song called Code Monkey that I like, as well as a song about the Mandelbrot set. But he also wrote a song called “The Future Soon.” It it, the protagonist sings:
 Last week I left a note on Laura’s desk It said I love you signed anonymous friend Turns out she’s smarter than I thought she was She knows I wrote it, now the whole class does too … But I know that I’ll forget the look of pity in her face When I’m living in my solar dome on a platform in space.</description>

It shows his skill and composure at leading despite his young age. It also shows the beautiful setting of Ida Noyes Hall at the University of Chicago. The discerning and knowing eye will see lots of midwest and nationwide Sacred Harp worthies around the square.</description>

      <description>This has been a delightful weekend. On Saturday, I attended the Golden Gate Sacred Harp singing in San Francisco (with a nice Après-chant at Philip’s house, nicely described by Linda, who also has pictures of the singing). In the morning today, Jeff Shrager took me to see redwoods and banana slugs and tidepools, capped by some nice bluegrass music at a cafe. Worship at Sojourners was also good.
Back in Michigan, I missed some cool things happening.</description>

      <description>Maggie Leonard, responding to Linda’s statement about singing Sacred Harp that I quoted recently:
 That says it all. I’m not a doctrinal Christian. I tried for years to accept the doctrinal view of Jesus, but couldn’t when I searched my soul. However, this music rises beyond doctrine and summons the spirit that moved among the apostles after Jesus’ passing. That spirit moves through us like water when we sing, cleansing and purifying.</description>

 Sometimes I need to shout down my fear, sometimes I need to voice praise and thanks, other times I need to join my dead. Right now, what I need most is a sweet song that makes me feel held by God. The All-California Sacred Harp Convention this past weekend was all these things.</description>

A gymanfa is a Welsh hymn sing; Sam is a fellow Sacred Harp singer with relatives at Salem, and it was great fun talking with him to and from Venedocia. The singing itself was interestingly different from Sacred Harp singing. We sat in parts, but we had a director (Trevor Williams) who would instruct us and even stop us if he wanted to correct or encourage certain things.</description>

“The Parting Hand” is the tune most frequently sung at the end of a Sacred Harp convention.

Rachel is one of the Goshen, Indiana Sacred Harp singers, and it was with great pleasure that some of us were able to sing as a prelude to her ordination service, which was marked by good prayers, lovely singing, an excellent call to ministry by one of her seminary professors, and much obvious love for Rachel by the congregration she serves as the minister of spiritual formation, and by Rachel for the people she serves and from whom she has learned.</description>

 The distribution of frequency to rank is an almost perfect lognormal curve for the 11 years (98% correlation). I was surprised to see that Liberty (137) has the biggest downward trend over the 11 year period — it’s ‘batting average’ dropped from .</description>

      <description>It was good–make that great–to be singing at home. It’s hard to believe that it was just a year ago that I led my first tune at a Kalamazoo singing. It was wonderful to sing with Bess and Idy Kiser in the morning and then between David Ivey and Judy Hauff in the afternoon. It was very hot and humid again, and we actually finished a bit early as a result, after everyone had a chance to lead.</description>

      <description>It was a very good singing today in Goshen; as Mark Miller has remarked, it’s a bit like singing inside the body of a guitar. Lots of southern singers, a very fierce alto section, excellent food. It was stifling hot–in the high 90’s, I think, and humid–but somehow that was all right. Sam Sommers: we’re going to take a break now, and be sure to try and rehydrate yourselves, and if you can’t do that, at least drink some water.</description>

      <description>Here’s how it happened. Jessica Beer, a fierce alto from Portland sent out an email:
 Hello everyone … especially my fine friends to the coastal south! 39 I’ll be traveling through California over the next couple of weeks, and I wonder if anyone out there would like to meet me for some random singing. I have very little flexibility, due to the nature of my trip, so here are the dates I will be in each city, and some indication of the times I might be available as well.</description>

John has several other recordings available, too.</description>

The page is Christian Harmony Recordings, and contains all of the MP3 files from Tom’s four Christian Harmony CDs, including his latest, Newfound Hills, which is an interesting ‘teaching CD’ with Tom singing all four parts.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month, the annual Pauline Creel Birthday singing was held in Wayne , Michigan (in the Ann Arbor/Detroit area). “Miss Pauline” comes from one of the “singing families” in the Sacred Harp tradition–that is, one of the extended families in the South that kept (and continue to keep) Sacred Harp music alive. Many of her family come up north for her birthday singing–I think I heard that some 30 people came for her 91st birthday.</description>

      <description>From Bridging the Church Music Gap, Sojourners Magazine/March 2006
 [A] number of churches that approach music from one pole or the other also dabble in less familiar material. Organists gamely plod through choruses, and praise bands rock out on old warhorse hymns. … But too often, this sort of music is programmed as an exception to the dominant pattern of whichever polarized model. Thus the overall tone of a service’s music—a deal-breaker for many people—is not really changed.</description>

      <description>In-car navigation systems can be distracting (1) Well, duh. (2) The article provides no details. This was probably an online poll conducted by YouGov by Privilege Insurance, a UK company. It’s hard to say whether there’s any chance of the survey being accurate, since no details are given in the Computerworld story (which might just be a Reuters reprint), and the study isn’t mentioned, as far as I can tell, on Priviledge’s website.</description>

      <description>I just got a reprint of William Billings’s Continental Harmony, which I guess is the last tunebook he published. The first tune is “An Anthem for Thanksgiving.” (You can hear it here: WGUC 90.9 FM | Feast for the Ears; it’s the first tune in the 2005 program). The first part of the text is taken from Psalm 148, and then continues with these great words:
Ye dragons whose contagious breath, People the dark abodes of death, Change your dire hissings into heavenly songs, And praise your maker with your forked tongues.</description>

      <description>We demo’d the Autonomous Rotocraft Project at Moffett Field today–not just any demo, but the “5 year demo,” the capstone of the project. I was a bit nervous, since I had a major role to play in the demo script, but hadn’t actually been able to practice with the real helicopter. There was a tricky bit where I had to induce a simulated ‘communication fault,’ so the helicopter could respond in a useful way–but it had to be done at just the right time; that is, where a communication fault could occur and be successfully taken care of.</description>

      <description>David W. Music of Baylor led a Sacred Harp workshop at the Calvin Symposium on Worship at Calvin College today. A good number of people where there– a hundred or more, including very large alto and treble sections. They were good, experienced singers who, for the most part, were unfamiliar with Sacred Harp singing.
David did a masterful job of leading people through the shapes and eleven tunes. He started with Martin, a good choice for new Sacred Harp singers struggling with the shapes because there is a lot of repitition and it’s ususally sung slowly.</description>

      <description>Nice essay by Natalia: On outsourcing art.
 Singing is a particularly sticky issue. There’s something horribly personal about letting a sound that’s unique to your body come out of your belly, susceptible to being heard by others — a bodily emission rendered as sound. Could such a thing ever be wanted? Even playing a cello (that lengthy embrace) is more detached. There’s an element of that embarrassing affect, enthusiasm, that’s necessarily present in singing.</description>

 While evolution has produced in all classes of vertebrate a great diversity of vocal courtship displays, loud synchronous chorusing employing amplitude summation of multiple voices may have played a special role in human evolution. The abstract from Todd and Merker’s paper:
  Measurements are reported of the intensity of the siamang gibbon loud call obtained from the vocal bouts of three family groups at Twycross Zoo, UK.</description>

In December, I sang with the Goshen Sacred Harp group, which traditionally sings out of the Harmonia Sacra for the second half of their December singing.</description>

      <description>The first half of the manuscript of Twain’s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which was begun in 1876 and published in 1885, was discovered in 1990 ‘in an old steamer trunk stored in the attic of a Los Angeles house.’ It includes a description of a camp meeting that is more expansive than the published version. I thought the readers of this mail list would be interested in the published and manuscript versions of the beginning part of the story, in which a preacher is lining out a hymn.</description>

      <description>Really good Kalamazoo Sacred Harp singing yesterday. There were only six people when we began to sing, but with Roger Williams singing bass, Molly Williams on alto, and Ann Miczulski singing treble, and the always strong leading tenor of Samuel Sommers, we were well covered. We started with lots of minor plain tunes–Mear, Wells and the like. We sang Stafford, the object of some controversy because of its words, because some of us didn’t even know how it sounded (with some instructions on how to change the words, and explicit permission not to sing).</description>

      <description>“Stafford” is a tune in the Sacred Harp. It’s a pretty tune, I think. It is periodicially the proximate cause of discussions on the Sacred Harp mailing list because of the lyrics to which it is set in in the Sacred Harp:
See what a living stone The builders did refuse, Yet God hath built His Church thereon, In spite of env’ous Jews.
The sticking point is, of course, the last phrase: “envious Jews.</description>

      <description>My work brings me to California once a month or so, and, if I can, I sing with the one of the Bay area Sacred Harp groups, usually the Berkeley group, which meets every Monday night. The biggest problem is the longish drive in heavy traffic up to Berkeley on top of a day that starts at 5 am Michigan time. I arrived quite tired, and made many silly mistakes–flubbing even New Britian (Amazing Grace) and calling “Southwell” “Southfield”–a Michigan city, as Mark pointed out.</description>

      <description>I thought that Florida Storm was protected by copyright, but now I believe it is in the public domain, having been written in 1928. So here are the complete lyrics (according to this thread on Mudcat:
September eighteenth, nineteen hundred and twenty-six, The people cried mercy in the storm, Their cries were too late their crying was in vain, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.
Chorus: The people cried mercy in the storm, The people cried mercy in the storm, The colored and the white stay’d awake all the night, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.</description>

      <description>There has been an interesting discussion about composing on the Sacred Harp mailing list; one of the subtopics has been a perennial favorite: what makes a ‘good’ Sacred Harp tune. One of the desiderata is that parts be interesting to sing as themselves; i.e., a kind of polyphony. I’m curious how one could model ‘interestingness’ computationally. For example, a more varied tune is generally more interesting than a less varied one, so perhaps the variance of interval changes could be a simple model of interestingness.</description>

      <description>I’ve done an analysis of how frequently hymns from the Denson book were chosen during annual singings in 2004 (as recorded by the Sacred Harp Minutes book).
I tried to be careful to count only selections from Denson. I didn’t look at choices from singings specifically listed as Cooper Book or ‘mixed’ singings. I used a semi-automated process to do the counting.
Perhaps the most interesting difference between the 2002 frequencies is the apparent strong effect of Cold Mountain — 282, I’m Going Home, is was the most chosen tune in 2004.</description>

“Holy Manna” is also known as “Brethren we have met to worship.” “New Britian” is the tune to which “Amazing Grace” is usually sung.</description>

      <description>Warren Steel, who is at the Department of Music at the University of Mississippi, had access to the original poem, by Edward Young. His “Night Thoughts” was a popular series of poems–Blake illustrated them, for example. Steel wrote on the Sacred Harp mailing list:
 I have a copy of Young’s Night Thoughts handy. Night 4 is the Christian Triumph.

In Easter Anthem (236), the poetry ends:
Man, all immortal hail,
Hail heaven, all lavish of strange gifts to man,
Thine’s all the glory,
Man’s the boundless bliss.</description>

Mark was off to a ‘black-tie’ party of this own (having found a spiffy tuxedo for $20 dollars–shades of Napoleon Dynamite–at a thrift store).
