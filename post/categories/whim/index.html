 Once you’ve spotted a cliché… they’ve lost their impact [they’ve] become stale Some people just tune out make a point [they may miss the point that you’re trying to make] use [something] as a starting point indispensable advice  At least they didn’t say “avoid clichés like the plague,” the clichéd anti-cliché joke.

      I enjoyed reading the Wikipedia page about its “lamest edit wars.” One of these edit wars was whether the article on what Americans call “aluminum” and what Brits call “aluminium” should have, as its fundamental title, “Aluminum,” or “Aluminium.” And, one of the arguments presented in favo(u)r of “Aluminum” was that more Google hits are available for the US spelling than the UK spelling. “Ghits” is notoriously unreliable (as are Bing hits and the other search engines), since the number of search results reported are subject to lots of factors, not of which is tied directly to actual number of documents returned.

      It has often been noted that English is deficient because it lacks a third-person pronoun that can refer to any person, without respect to sexual gender. Although some claim that “he” can refer to anyone in sentences like (1), most linguists agree that maleness is much more salient in these cases than a generic sense.

 Will Fitzgerald didn’t use a computer until he was 23. It had cards. It is difficult for Will Fitzgerald to refer to himself in the third person. Despite his descriptivist linguistic training, Will Fitzgerald tries to distinguish ‘between’ and ‘among’. Will Fitzgerald was known as “Bill” until he was 33. Will Fitzgerald has half of a house named in his honor.

I came across an earlier example from 1793, in Elder John Leland’s “The history of Jack Nips”:
 Like other boys, I wished to be in fashion, and as the Presbyterians were the most fashionable, I applied myself to the study of their books, but was not a little puzzled to reconcile their writings with my boyish thoughts.

 You protect your arms and hands legs and save your eyes. If you see a blasting cap remember now, don’t touch them. Tell a police or a fireman or whatever it is. Have fun like I do with those (baseball mitt, bat and ball) and not with these (blasting caps!!) Anyone I’ve ever met who is exactly my age in years and grew up near Detroit remembers this with fear.

My first try was abysmal: 11/50. Yesterday was worse: 10/50. Today, almost, but not quite, not terrible: 19/50.

      From ‘In pursuit of the G-d shot‘:
 Millions of people probably get great coffee every morning with a standard home machine and ground coffee from a supermarket. I was starting to worry that, with a process that has as many variables as pulling an espresso, once you’re daft enough to go off piste, things get monumentally messy in a way only explicable with chaos theory. To go off piste is to go off the trail (in cross-country skiing, for example), to do something non-standard.

      Today’s Earth and Sky discusses a few topics mildly dear to my lunatic heart. They discuss blue moons and time zones.
 When there’s a second full moon of a calendar month, it’s come to be called a Blue Moon. I like the careful use of “it’s come to be called,” since it is a bit controversial what “blue moon” means, and where it comes from. But I think they’re right that “the second full moon of a calendar month” is the most common meaning of “blue moon” these days.

      Mark Liberman, in his usual engaging way, discusses “the tangled history of a mangled maxim” at Language Log.
It was prompted by a statement in Bush’s State of the Union address: “Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required,” which should be (to be parsable) something like “To whom much is given, of them much is required.”
Liberman notes that this eventually goes back to the New Testament, specifically Luke 12:48, which, in King James’s Engish, is: “For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required.

      Mark Liberman (to whom I emailed about Zonker’s use of ‘my brave‘), wrote about ‘My adjective‘ on Language Log. As usual, he has interesting things to say. He points out that
 One small issue is that second-person forms like “your idiotic” are homophonous with the corresponding clausal forms “you’re idiotic” etc. But that sort of ambiguity between innovation and conservatism may be an advantage.

      It’s hard to believe I’ve never tried it before, but I finally did today, and I liked it. Maybe I’ll do it every Monday, then maybe I’ll try it on Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, and work up to the hard stuff on Sundays. It was fun, my wife turned me on to it. What I tried was pretty tame by her standards–she does the really hard stuff, stuff that takes over her brain sometimes for days at a time before it’s done and she can return to normal life.

      Tim Converse reports on recruiting trip to Michigan he made–that is, Michigan the University. He asked the audience trivia questions, including “how many trailing zeros in 100 factorial?”
I remember seeing 100! for the first time:
93,­326,­215,­443,­944,­152,­681,­699,­238,­856,­266,­700,­490,­715,­968,­264,­381,­621,­468,­592,­963,­895,­217,­599,­993,­229,­915,­608,­941,­463,­976,­156,­518,­286,­253,­697,­920,­827,­223,­758,­251,­185,­210,­916,­864,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000
I wondered where all those (24) zeroes came from, but I never took the time to figure it out.
Nor did I have time to figure it out as I read Tim’s post, but I did have a couple of minutes to write a Lisp program to compute n!

 A variation on the döner kebab known as a Donair was introduced in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in the early 1970s. A restaurant called The King Of Donairs claims to have been the first to serve this version in 1973. The meat in this version is sliced from a loaf made from a combination of ground beef, flour or bread crumbs, and various spices, while the sauce is made from evaporated milk, sugar, vinegar, and sometimes garlic.

      On advice from Rob Harris, I went to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Unfortunately, I only had about an hour to visit, since the musuem doesn’t open until 11:00 am, and I had a flight out in mid-afternoon. Still, it was a wonderful hour, well spent enjoying the gestalt of the musuem, famously controlled by Gardner’s will to neither add nor subtract from the musuem’s holdings. The courtyard is delightful; it, and the sight of a stained glass window as I turned a corner, both made me gasp.

      The New Yorker has a somewhat amusing application form for disgruntled Democrats who want to move to Canada, which includes this question:
 Translate the following statement: “Cripes, grade thirteen! Here’s a loonie — buy a Coffee Crisp, eh?”Geoff Pullum can’t make heads or tails of it. But (having been a Canadian resident for several weeks and author of The Canadian Quiz, I think I’m on the case:

      I remembered a post by Mark Liberman about disambiguation of complex nominals when I visited a doughnut shop today. The post points out that, when trying to determine automatically whether a phrase like “sickle cell anemia” is (say) sickle-type cell anemia or an anemia of sickle cells — i.e., whether it’s [sickle] [cell anemia] or [sickle cell] [anemia]–you can do something very simple, which works very well in practice: count the number of times “sickle cell” and “cell anemia” occur in a large body of texts, and the more frequent is likely to be the right grouping.

      I was at a bookstore yesterday, and came across an American slang dictionary. “Flub the dub” was included, meaning to make a mistake. Google gives more results, including translations of American slang into Korean and Russian.
Via Yahoo Search: Flub-a-dub was a cast member on Howdy Doody. Flubadubya is a screen name on the Democratic Underground. And, finally, it even shows up in the Bible.

      I was listening to Johnny Cash’s version of “In the Jailhouse Now,” which has the line:
 Well Old Bill really flubbed his dub when he wore a tuxedo to the country club. I did a quick search for “flubbed his dub” on Google, and only this Hindu Unity rant came back. You can find “flub your dub” a couple of times, including this bluegrass song. I assume that ‘flub (your) dub” means make a big mistake; but how did this Southernism get to India?
