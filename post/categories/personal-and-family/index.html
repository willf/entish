      Just a short note — this is a very busy week for me. I am preparing to return to live in Michigan, after eight months or so in California. I’ll still be working for Wordnik — thank God and Tony Tam — but mostly working remotely. I’ll be coming to California once a month, as I have done in the past prior to working for Wordnik.
Also, my son Mark has just moved from China and is staying with me this week.

He was a school counselor, and a coach for the basketball team. He was also the sponsor of the Human Relations Club, a club created to get black kids and white kids like me to learn more about what I now might call anti-racism, but then we mostly called non-discrimination.

When Robert joined Wordnik over a year ago, I badgered him into getting me an interview–it’s only now that it’s come to fruition.

Junior High school geometry, for me, was mostly about learning to do proofs — classic Elements of Euclid stuff.

The massive storms and numerous tornadoes that hit Alabama changed our plans.

A response to “Faux Friendship,” by William Deresiewicz 1
Deresiewicz decries social networking sites, especially Facebook, especially in the way that relationships between users of Facebook are called “friends.” Writing a status message is “like pornography.” We have no time for stories. Our relationships are commercialized. We are overwhelmed with the number of false friends. Facebook “seduces” us. It’s a “mirage.” Facebook friends are simulacra of friends.

I may be writing some weblog posts, and updating Facebook notes (and perhaps status), but after today, don’t expect to hear from me much except via the old ways, such as the Tele-Phone, Facsimile Transmission, and E-Mail.

I had to work on Friday (“Work—the curse of the singing class,” quipped Richard Schmeidler at dinner one day), and Tom is in the midst of a move back east. So, it was convenient to do this—as if driving 13 hours one way is anyone’s idea of ‘convenient.

 Will Fitzgerald didn’t use a computer until he was 23. It had cards. It is difficult for Will Fitzgerald to refer to himself in the third person. Despite his descriptivist linguistic training, Will Fitzgerald tries to distinguish ‘between’ and ‘among’. Will Fitzgerald was known as “Bill” until he was 33. Will Fitzgerald has half of a house named in his honor.

      I had a short article published in our local paper, the Kalamazoo Gazette:
 It was New Year’s Eve, and things were finally starting to go right. Our car had broken down outside Forsyth, Ga., on Christmas Eve, and we had had to hitchhike to northern Florida to visit my mother, leaving our car at a garage for repairs. When we got back to Forsyth, the repair shop declared even more repairs were necessary, and we had to ask my wife’s parents to wire us some money.

      David G. Lockwood has died, reports the Linguist List.
David Lockwood was one of my professors when I did my degree in linguistics at Michigan State in the 70’s. He was (and remained, I think) an adherent of “stratificationalism,” a kind of constraint-based network theory of language. His classes were the closest I had to mathematical (remember, this was in the heyday of symbolist linguistic theory). I also took historical linguistics, structural (descriptive) linguistics and phonology from him.

      This past weekend, Bess, Jane and I attended the 50th anniversary of the founding of Reba Place Church, the church we attended in the 90’s when I was in graduate school and for a few years afterwards. Saturday was spent going though a decade by decade retrospective. Reba began as, essentially, a commune in the 50’s and experienced explosive growth through the 60s and 70s. They allowed non-communal members in the 80s and there were many aftershocks of many of the communal members becoming everyday variety congregational members.

      Bess and I made a quickie visit “up north” to see two of my brothers and their families. Here are a few pictures from our visit to Ed’s house.
Ed just bought a pretty cool chipper–he does a lot of part time work cutting down trees, and chipping them.
Even cooler, Ed bought an old firetruck from the Baldwin fire department. He hopes to put a pick on it to get up higher in the trees.

      Fred Clark has a provocative article, Dirty work, that makes an interesting point about people who do the ‘dirty work’ of torture, such as our American agents who engage in tortuous activities such as waterboarding. First, he notes that these people, at the end of the day, must enjoy their work, and thus are worthy of being called sadists, sociopaths, sexual perverts or worse.

      An article in Ventureblog about Powerset, the company I work for, has kicked up a minor storm in the blogosphere about Powerset and the very idea of natural language search. I’d just like to point people to a weblog post by Barney Pell, our CEO, on Powerset and Natural Language Search. For those who might wonder why I’m working for Powerset, Barney’s vision explains it well:
 Seen in this light, there is enormous room for fundamental innovation in search, as the game has only just begun.

When I was thinking about moving to San Francisco to work for the startup, I began to suspect that the toothpaste would run out about the same time as when I might come to the Bay Area.

And you did it when you were in your late 60’s–as part of your “outward journey” to serve God in the world, which also included your leadership in the local Bread for the World group.
When Yofi, our beloved cat, scratched our new baby’s face out of jealousy, and we had to find it a home, you took Yofi in, and made her fat and happy.

This is the first time I’ve lived in the city, though, and I think what has struck me most has been the people–there are lots of ’em, and many different kinds.

      We had parent-teacher conferences today. This is almost always a discouraging time.
Jane’s teacher showed us a “persuasive essay” she wrote for her social studies class. The students were to take a stand of whether the US government should spy on people to prevent terrorism. Jane’s first sentence went something like this:
The US government should spy on people to prevent terrorism, but they should do so in a way the protects the privacy rights of citizens.

      Earlier this month, the annual Pauline Creel Birthday singing was held in Wayne , Michigan (in the Ann Arbor/Detroit area). “Miss Pauline” comes from one of the “singing families” in the Sacred Harp tradition–that is, one of the extended families in the South that kept (and continue to keep) Sacred Harp music alive. Many of her family come up north for her birthday singing–I think I heard that some 30 people came for her 91st birthday.

      Spring seems to be arriving. We drove across southern Michigan yesterday (to pick son Mark up from a weeklong internship with my Aunt Kathleen, who is a real estate agent), and then to mid-Michigan to take Mark back to university. We saw dozens of groupings of Canada geese arriving, as well as sand hill cranes. Three fat turkeys were waddling in one field, and lots of hawks. One gave me a good show as it came in across the highway to attack its prey on the center strip.

We started with lots of minor plain tunes–Mear, Wells and the like. We sang Stafford, the object of some controversy because of its words, because some of us didn’t even know how it sounded (with some instructions on how to change the words, and explicit permission not to sing).

      Every year I attempt to update our address list, especially in order to send out Christmas cards. The original database of addresses I created is gone; I can’t remember what I originally used. Last year was too choatic to do anything. This year I decided to create the list from scratch. In fact, I decided I would just write out addresses in an address book.
In the end, though, I had a brainstorm.
