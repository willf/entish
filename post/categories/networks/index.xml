      <description>Renkoo has officially gone into “beeta” status. Renkoo is social webware(*) that helps people get together for fun or whatever. Good luck, Renkoo! My friend Joyce Park’s giving me a fetching black and pink tee-shirt has nothing to do with this shout out–I’m much too old to shout out (or, I suppose, wear black and pink).
*I’d hoped that I’d invented this term, but, not surprisingly, it already exists.</description>

      <description>The San Francisco Chronicle has published an interesting graphic showing the number of suicides per location at the Golden Gate Bridge (each location is linked to a light pole, of which there are 128). My morbid curiosity asked whether this would show a long tail-like distribution, given the “many choices, many choosers” nature this. Well, here it is; you decide:</description>

      <description>The Art of the Fast Take: good stuff by my cousin-in-law Tim Oren on learning (about) a new field in a hurry. (Although the last recommendation — hire someone to learn it for you — might be a bit too specific to VCs).</description>

      <title>2004 Sacred Harp Frequency of Choices</title>
      <link>http://example.org/2005/06/04/2004-sacred-harp-frequency-of-choices/</link>

      <description>I’ve done an analysis of how frequently hymns from the Denson book were chosen during annual singings in 2004 (as recorded by the Sacred Harp Minutes book).
I tried to be careful to count only selections from Denson. I didn’t look at choices from singings specifically listed as Cooper Book or ‘mixed’ singings. I used a semi-automated process to do the counting.
Perhaps the most interesting difference between the 2002 frequencies is the apparent strong effect of Cold Mountain — 282, I’m Going Home, is was the most chosen tune in 2004.</description>

      <description>I posted this note to the fasola.org mailing list (Sacred Harp singing discussions):
“Holy Manna” is also known as “Brethren we have met to worship.” “New Britian” is the tune to which “Amazing Grace” is usually sung.</description>
