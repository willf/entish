      <title>Elasticsearch 1.6 upserts and partial updates</title>

      <description>To partially update an Elasticsearch document in 1.6, you’ll need to create a script for the partial update, and potentially use an upsert.
For example, you want to add tags to a blog post
here’s an example of a document created directly:
POST /website/blog/1/_update { “doc” : { “tags” : [ “testing” ], “views”: 0 } }
but if we want to add a tag without changing the view, you need to create a script in config/scripts</description>

      <description>As kind of a 10-finger exercise, I decided to write a small inverted index library in Ruby today, since I had the day off. This is just a few thoughts about what it was like to write tests for this code, which can be found at [https://github.com/willf/inverted_index_simple]1–not that I think you’ll write the next major search engine with this bit of code…
What struck me was that as I was writing unit tests, how many of the tests failed at first either because of undefined variables or dynamic typing problems.</description>

      <description>All geekdom, and much that is outside our realm, is abuzz with news and discussion of the contest by IBM’s Jeopardy-playing computer, Watson, vs Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. In last night’s game (the second half of a game started on Monday, Watson won decisively, answering many, many more questions than Jennings and Rutter combined. At the end of the first half, Rutter and Watson were tied. Lots of famous (and formerly famous) artificial intelligence researchers have weighed in on what this means for AI.</description>

      <description>[Disclaimer: I work for Bing as a senior research software developer, but I do not speak for Bing]
Matt Cutts has a thoughtful follow-up articleon the controversy over whether Bing is copying Google’s search results. There has been a little too much heat and not enough light in the discussion, and I appreciate reflective thoughts, and his shout out to us Bing engineers. Someday, we’ll have forgotten all about this controversy.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I work for Bing as a senior research software developer, but I do not speak for Bing; I am writing this on my own time and behalf.
Google has accused Bing of cheating, of copying Google’s results (Danny Sullivan’s article which broke the news; Google’s official blog post with the accusation). Basically, Google set up a honeypot of synthetic (that is, unique, non-word) search keys which their results led to specifically selected (i.</description>

      <description>Bing (my employer, but here a different area) has announced new publicly available NGram data, current to April 2010. It includes 1 through 5-grams for title, anchor and body streams (that is, HTML page titles, text in anchor links, and overall HTML body text).</description>

      <description>Let’s say you want to investigate the use of “tweet” as a verb (see “Tweet this” at Language Log), and you want to collect, oh, 10,000 examples or so and do some concordance work, for example:
This is simple to do with a bash command line, perl, Ruby, the Tweetstream gem, and a spreadsheet program (or just plain old grep).
To download 10,000 tweets containing “tweet,” “tweets”, or “tweeting” and save them in a file called “tweet.</description>

      <description>I’ve seen two references to “nip it in the butt” for “nip it in the bud” recently, which reminded me of the “avoid like the plaque” post.
It’s a little harder to get statistics for this based on the public Bing data, which only goes to four tokens. But here are the most common following words for “nip in the ___”:
bud:46.79%, air:45.60%, h: 2.53%, butt: 1.05%, taste: 0.95%, form: 0.</description>

      <description>I noticed that the expression “avoid like the plaque” showing up in some search results I was doing. This is “plaque” with-a-queue, not “plague”-with-a-gee. This seems like an odd misspelling to me, and I was curious how often this occurs. The Bing Ngram data gives us the tools: given “avoid like the”, the word “plague” occurs 98.68% of the time (in the web body data). The word “plaque” is the second most common word, occurring 0.</description>

      <description>I’ve updated the Microsoft NGram Ruby library to provide an example use: segmenting Twitter hashtags. Twitter hashtags have been used for some time to tag tweets according to users’ choice and whimsy. Coincidentally, my daytime boss has just conducted an interview with William Morgan–formerly of Powerset, but now at Twitter–about hash tags, in case you want to come up to speed on what they are. It’s a fun read in any case, including the origin story of hash tags.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed reading the Wikipedia page about its “lamest edit wars.” One of these edit wars was whether the article on what Americans call “aluminum” and what Brits call “aluminium” should have, as its fundamental title, “Aluminum,” or “Aluminium.” And, one of the arguments presented in favo(u)r of “Aluminum” was that more Google hits are available for the US spelling than the UK spelling. “Ghits” is notoriously unreliable (as are Bing hits and the other search engines), since the number of search results reported are subject to lots of factors, not of which is tied directly to actual number of documents returned.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I wrote about whether there was evidence that people tend to “buy a home and sell a house,” and used Google’s n-gram data (based on web documents) to suggest this wasn’t the case. I happened to come across this post today, and wondered whether some of the query streams I have access to now might say something to this. I looked at our frequently “sell” or “buy” co-occur with “house” or “home” in a stream of about 36 million queries.</description>

      <description>(The usual disclaimers: my opinion only, not my current or future employers)
When Powerset began a couple of years ago, a lot of commentators called us — and still do call us — a would be Google killer. This, despite repeated comments by senior staff that this wasn’t what we were about. As a company, Google is hard to beat. Our goal was audacious, but not that audacious. Our goal was to build a better search experience: to use natural language technology to provide better search results, both by having a better understanding of web documents as well as user queries.</description>

It’s been 100 years since “American inventor and Kentucky melon farmer” Nathan B. Stubblefield received the patent for the first wireless cell phone (UK Telegraph article, via Mirabilis).
Today, the company I work for, Powerset, launched its search product for general public use at powerset.com. It’s a really cool search and browsing engine for Wikipedia, with lots of information gleaned from the Freebase project as well.</description>

But then I noticed that the vast majority of edits in the past sixty days are about the vast conspiracy behind 9/11 and the new world order. The original 9/11 start page says it’s being done by “the Dutch cooperation to find out the truth behind the events relating to 9/11/2001.</description>

 I was amused by calculating the number of video tags football (soccer) and rugby on Dailymotion (English pages). No doubt, soccer is more popular than rugby! The original French (from Jean Véronis’s blog):

      <description>There must be an antonym for ‘hype.’ To hype something is to engage in hyperbole about it: Apple products have generated their share of hype. (For example: Steve Jobs said, “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”) I don’t mean ‘anti-hype’ in the sense of telling the approximate truth about something, desengaño or dis-illusionment. But after the IPhone announcement, Steve Ballmer said, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.</description>

He describes life and work at Powerset, some of the risks, the culture of openness at Powerset, and why we don’t see Google as the enemy. Granted, it’s not a hard-hitting interview (Liu even says “I am looking forward to … exploring long-term career opportunties in Powerset,” which blunts one’s objectivity), but it gives a good picture of what Powerset is like.</description>

      <description>This is nice: in addition to automated translation, Google has now added translation dictionaries, for English to Spanish, French, Italian, German and Korean, and back again.They seem a bit dated: no translations for “weblog” or “telecommute” or even “google.” But it does have “computer virus.”</description>

      <description>I’ve glad Marti Hearst is writing for the Powerset blog from time to time. She’s written a nice post about antonyms (‘Opposites attract’), pairs of words which are ‘opposite’ in meaning.
I also enjoy reading The Atlantic’s Word Fugitive column, in which people are asked to come up with new (almost always humorous) terms for things and events. For example, “the moment of undignified vulnerability that people in airport security lines feel when they have to take off their shoes.</description>

      <description>It looks like Powerset (my company) is officially signing people up for Powerlabs, which is set to open in September, according to a message sent from our COO, Steve Newcomb, to his linkedin buddies.
 Powerlabs won’t be fully operational until September, but we will need beta testers. If you want the chance to be the first to get the scoop on Powerset, sign up now. Hint: Tell us if you blog and we will send you early announcements.</description>

Google keeps tweaking its search engine.
Fav quote:
 [H]owever easy it is to wax poetic about the modern-day miracle of Google, the site is also among the world’s biggest teases. Millions of times a day, users click away from Google, disappointed that they couldn’t find the hotel, the recipe or the background of that hot guy. Google often finds what users want, but it doesn’t always.</description>

      <description> The uniqueness and immense pragmatic convenience of proper names in our language lie precisely in the fact that they enable us to refer publicly to objects without being forced to raise issues and come to agreement on what descriptive characteristics exactly constitute the identity of the object. They function not as descriptions, but as pegs on which to hang descriptions (Searle).

      <description>Why are you reading this, when you should be reading Natalia’s ball-peen hammer to the head?
One of the many things that it takes for a computer to “understand” text (as we are trying to do at Powerset) is for it recognize names and what they refer to. So for example, in the sentence “Maid Marian is the female companion to the legendary figure Robin Hood.”, a computer needs to see the names Maid Marian and Robin Hood are present, and have some kind of internal representation of Ms.</description>

David Smith at The Guardian hypes web 2.0 (or web 3.0) and writes “The new Google is … Powerset.”
Calm down, everyone. Read what Barney Pell (Powerset CEO), Lorenzo Thione (Product Architect) and Steve Newcomb (COO) are saying on their blogs, especially Barney’s comments on Google and Powerset in the Sunday Times:
 Search is in its early days, and natural language is the future of search. But it’s both difficult to enable natural language search at all, and to do it on a scale like Google is a harder matter still.</description>

What’s that you say, a company can’t have a blog? That there’s no difference between a company blog and a press release? Silly you: Press releases talk about the company in the third person, have an about section, and a media contact.</description>

      <description>An article in Ventureblog about Powerset, the company I work for, has kicked up a minor storm in the blogosphere about Powerset and the very idea of natural language search. I’d just like to point people to a weblog post by Barney Pell, our CEO, on Powerset and Natural Language Search. For those who might wonder why I’m working for Powerset, Barney’s vision explains it well:
 Seen in this light, there is enormous room for fundamental innovation in search, as the game has only just begun.</description>

      <description>I think this is the first writeup of the company I work for, Powerset, that I’ve seen: Spying an intelligent search engine. Barney Pell, our CEO, is interviewed.
 Search engines try to train us to become good keyword searchers. We dumb down our intelligence so it will be natural for the computer,” said Pell, whose company, Powerset, is based in Palo Alto, Calif. “The big shift that will happen in society is that instead of moving human expressions and interactions into what’s easy for the computer, we’ll move computers’ abilities to handle expressions that are natural for the human,” he said.</description>

      <description>The always interesting Jean Veronis posts about page duplicates in English and French.
He investigates how many pages are returned for a search for the new word “ségolisme” (for which he can control at bit for precision numbers), and how many of these are duplicates due to RSS feeds, etc. A money quote:
 So, what are all these pages that Google considers to be similar? On closer inspection we can see that they are mainly RSS versions of the same page, archived pages (a blog often presents the same post in an individual version and also in a weekly or monthly archive), versions of posts both with and without comments, and links such as “trackback” or “new comments”, which are also commonplace on blogs.</description>
