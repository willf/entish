Francis Bacon, translated by Will Fitzgerald August 1, 2015
“What is truth?” asked jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Certainly there have been those who delight in giddiness, and count it bondage to settle on a belief, who affect free will in thinking as well as in acting. And though the schools of philosophers of that kind are gone, there remain certain chattering wits of the same vein—though not with as much blood in them as there was in the ancients.

      Word vectors have become increasingly important in as features in machine learning models for natural language processing. The idea is to represent a word in some multidimensional space (the vector) in which words which are “similar” are similar in that space. Typically, one hopes that word vectors will provide some kind of semantic similarity. A typical party trick is to use word vectors to solve word analogy problems; e.g., king is to queen as man is to ?

      What is Named Entity Recognition? Named Entity Recognition (or NER) is the task of finding all the names of things in a text. For example, in the sentence “Jimi Hendrix played ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at Woodstock,” NER, correctly done, would find the references to “Jimi Hendrix,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and “Woodstock.” Note that NER should also extract names it has never previously seen; for example, in the sentence “Johannes von Smetly is the protagonist in Willard Smith’s new novel”, an NER system should extract “Johannes von Smetly” as a name, even if it it doesn’t appear in any standard name list.

      What is part of speech tagging? Part of speech tagging (POS tagging) is a classification problem: assigning each word or token in a text to a “part of speech,” that is, a lexical/grammatical class for each token. Different theories, or (perhaps more importantly) different uses will suggest different sets of grammatical labels, but they typically include nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. For example, the sentence “John thinks it’s all good.” might be tagged as:

But then I realized that I could create a separate object which maintained the state, and which performed the calculations, too.

      We are now confident that the fast recursive version is the best of the algorithms we have explored — it is fast, and can handle large values of the Fibonacci function.
I haven’t been happy, though, with returning a negative -1 when the function is called with a negative number — this feels like a kind of silent error we were trying to avoid in going to BigInts. Fortunately, it turns out that there is a natural extension of the Fibonacci sequence to negative numbers.

      Although the iterative recursive version is stateless, it looks different from the standard mathematical definition. The recursive version is a very close mapping, but it’s extremely inefficient. One way to overcome the inefficiencies is to dynamically record (or memoize) previous calculations of F(n). The idea is simple — if we already know the values of F(n – 1) and F(n – 2), we can simply add them without having to do the difficult steps in recreating them.

Ron Knott has a web page with over 300 Fibonacci and φ formulas. One of these is this direct formula: F(n) = round(φn/√5), where the rounding function does rounding to the nearest whole number.
This gives us a quite an efficient function:

Yes, in fact. Recall that the definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:
F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
What’s important to note is that the recursive step of the Fibonacci formula has two values that need to be accumulated. In the iterative version, the two temporary variables u and v are used to accumulate these values.

      Yesterday’s iterative version of the Fibonacci function is pretty speedy, especially compared to the recursive version. It calculates F(1000) in almost no time at all —
But. The result for F(1000) looks suspiciously low — and odd things happen if we use a different ‘high’ number, such as 100:
As it turns out, Scala’s Int and Long types are always signed, and do silent overflow. Once the number gets to a certain size, adding more will turn it ‘negative,’ and adding even more will eventually turn it positive, but (of course) the number is not correct.

      Yesterday’s Fibonacci function was recursive, but we saw that it was extremely inefficient. Recursive functions typically break down a problem into smaller pieces, solve the smaller pieces, then combine the results into a final result, where “breaking down” a problem is done by the recursive function calling itself on a smaller version of itself. But, as we saw, it’s possible that the number of times this may happen has to be controlled, or gross inefficiencies may occur; this sometimes gives recursion a bad name.

      The definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:
F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
This naturally leads to the following recursive function (here, as in all of the versions of A Fibonacci A Day, in Scala):
Note that because we are in the world of Scala, we have to declare that we are writing a function on Ints (that is, the Java/Scala representation of 32-bit signed numbers).

      The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers 0,1,1,2,3,5,8, … such that the nth number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers; and the the first two numbers are defined to be 0 and 1.
The Fibonacci function is a function which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. It’s kind of a famous function in computer science when people are first learning about recursive functions.

Wordnik made the transition from Java to Scala before I joined them, and at least in my early days there, it seemed like the question was “Why Scala is a better Java.

Edit: But it does; see Erik Post’s comment below.
But, if you have a sequence of functions, for example:
val fns = List(() =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;, () =&gt; &quot;goodbye&quot;, () =&gt; &quot;good to see you&quot;)
You can create a sequence of futures on it (thus, running them in parallel): import scala.actors.Futures._ val futures = fns.

But this works for simple “ASCII” strings only. tr, at least on many systems, understands Unicode, and so the standard example fails for converting, say, Russian or Czech. But tr also understands character classes, so the standard example should be written tr [:upper:] [:lower:].

Today, I wanted to apply a list of filters to each item in a list, and return just those that pass each of the filters.
For example, given a range of integers, return just those that are divisible by 2 and by 3.
Let’s start by defining a boolean function divides:
Note that divides(2,_:Int) defines the (partial) function for division by 2.
So we can create our filters so:

      To implement a bloom filter, you need a bunch of hash functions. In naive implementations (and I’ve seen plenty), programmers pick out, say, five cryptographic hash functions. One problem with this is that the hash functions for bloom filters have different requirements than hash functions for cryptography–the latter tend to be more than is required for the former. What you want for bloom filters is something that’s very, very fast, while maintaining that basic desiderata for bloom filter hashing, uniform spread.

      Here’s a problem I faced at work: determine the effective top level domain of a URI, using the data from the Public Suffix List, but not using any data structures read into memory (ie, a dynamically created hash table or even a static array). For example, the effective top level domain of “http://blog.entish.org” is “entish.org”, because it is a name one could register.
So, there are about 4000 “positive” rules and about 100 “negative” rules.

It has lots of data types, an interesting alternative to object-oriented programming called interfaces, a reasonably-sized library, support for concurrency baked into the language, etc. The Go home page says it well:

      Geoffrey K Pullum, in Tweet this, a blog post at the inestimable Language Log, discusses the syntax of the neologism tweet and engagingly writes:
 Twitter merely coined a verb meaning “send a message via Twitter”, but they didn’t specify what linguists call its subcategorization possibilities. They added the verb to the dictionary, but they didn’t specify its grammar. The verb tweet is gradually developing its own syntax according to what it means and what its users regard as its combinatory possibilities.

If I were using a language with (compile-time) code macros (like Clojure, Scheme or Lisp), I’d prefer to write something like:
Measuring(&quot;SomeFeature&quot;){ComputeSomeFeature();} Measuring(&quot;AnotherFeature&quot;){ComputeAnotherFeature();}
But C# doesn’t have such a basic and useful thing, by design (bad design, I think, but still by design).
But C# does have first-class anonymous functions, so it’s possible to write methods that take one of these as a parameter.

      I’ve been playing with Microsoft Research’s ngram server in my spare time. I’ll write some more about this in time, I hope.
The API returns base 10 logs for its probabilities. Because the probabilities returned are so very low, it makes more sense to return a log probability. I could be wrong, but I think it’s normal practice to return base 2 logs, or base e logs for log probabilities. They are easily to convert from one base to another, so it doesn’t really matter.

Daughter and wife looked slightly alarmed, and dear wife asked if there were any chance that I was working myself out of a job. I said I didn’t think there was much chance that the coming robot wars were about to begin. Getting back to my computer later, I saw this on the console:

      It’s looking as if Neil Armstrong did say “One small step for a man…” rather than “One small step for man…”; this is what he has always maintained as his intent (Houston Chronicle story; via /.).
Perhaps someday historians will correct it again to “That’s one small step for a man; one giant leap for humanity.”
Update: I should have been a bit more skeptical, I think. At least taken a closer look at the data, which David Beaver has now done in a post on Language Log.

 You can see other pieces of the future [in addition to audio search and automatic translation] emerging as well. In-Q-Tel has a variety of investments in sensor related technology, including network architectures, next generation protein and gene chips, and fundamental nanotechnology fabrication techniques, with wide applicability to chemical and biological threats.

      As part of the Autonomous Rotorcraft Project, I was the main developer on the Mission Planner Interface (MPI). It’s a browser-based tool (requiring Firefox 1.5, Safari, or the latest Opera beta) that allows definition of observation targets that are sent off to the mission planner, which then creates a plan to visit all of the targets and then controls the heliocopter as it carries out the mission. One cool technical trick is that the MPI uses the new-fangled ‘Ajax’ ideas to talk to the plan execution system (well, talks to a server that talks to the system) so that, for example, the position of the helicopter is shown on the map, and to provide pan-and-zoom features (a la Google Maps).

      We demo’d the Autonomous Rotocraft Project at Moffett Field today–not just any demo, but the “5 year demo,” the capstone of the project. I was a bit nervous, since I had a major role to play in the demo script, but hadn’t actually been able to practice with the real helicopter. There was a tricky bit where I had to induce a simulated ‘communication fault,’ so the helicopter could respond in a useful way–but it had to be done at just the right time; that is, where a communication fault could occur and be successfully taken care of.

One thing I’ve learned is that the National Weather Service publishes ‘forecast discussions.’ These give the rationale for the government’s weather forecasts. For example, from today:
 After Sunday…the forecast becomes much less clear. Over the past several days…there has been significant variation in solutions both run-to-run of the same model and between the different longer-range models.

 What might a language look like in which parallelism is the default? How about data-parallel languages, in which you operate, at least conceptually, on all the elements of an array at the same time? These go back to APL in the 1960s, and there was a revival of interest in the 1980s when data-parallel computer architectures were in vogue.

My morbid curiosity asked whether this would show a long tail-like distribution, given the “many choices, many choosers” nature this. Well, here it is; you decide:

 Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may [a machine] not become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand? For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.

      Is this a potential solution to the production of hydrogen-fueled cars? Danish Researchers Reveal New Hydrogen Storage Technology. What are the possible pollution side-effects?
 In the process described in the article, ammonia (NH3) is produced as an intermediate step. The biggest challenge of this technology is creating a safe fuel tank that can hold ammonia, which can be harmful or fatal to people and animals in the vehicle, because: NH3 is immediately toxic at 500 ppm, NH3 reacts with water, producing ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), producing a lot of heat (‘exothermic reaction’) which could (say) blow up the car, NH3 is very cold when it is vaporized.

 Human-centered design has become such a dominant theme in design that it is now accepted by interface and application designers automatically, without thought, let alone criticism. That’s a dangerous state—when things are treated as accepted wisdom. The purpose of this essay is to provoke thought, discussion, and reconsideration of some of the fundamental principles of human-centered design.

The NCSA is somewhat disclaiming the index size study published on the NCSA website, and the study has been revised somewhat. Véronis is keeping up: his latest post, Technologies du Langage: Yahoo: Missing pages? (4), includes the original stronger disclaimer, and discusses why the revised study is still flawed.
 In conclusion, this new study is just as biaised as the previous one.

Jean Véronis has written a series of posts examining reported results from Google, Yahoo and MSN. One of the latest looks at the claim that Yahoo is indexing 19 billion pages.

      More than mirror neurons? A summary of an study reported in Neuron:
 Most importantly, the study affirms that there really isn’t a single fundamental visual representation in the brain — the representation used to recognize an object is not the same as the representation used to pick up that object. Because of the different functions of these tasks, this probably doesn’t sound too surprising but, to me, it is surprising!

      So, I’m doing what I thought would be a small browser-based project (kindof ‘Ajaxy’), but it turns out to be taking longer than I thought it would. Things are better than there were when I last did heavy web-dev work, especially considering that I am not worrying about being compatible with anything other than the latest FIrefox or Safari releases. But I’m writing a lot of Javascript, and it feels a bit like going back to the mid-80s, and I’m having to remember certain caveats that I haven’t had to thing about in a long time.

      U.S. security devices at ports to be replaced (via robotwisdom).
 After spending more than $4.5 billion on screening devices to monitor ports, borders, airports, mail and the air, the U.S. government is moving to replace or alter much of the antiterrorism equipment, concluding that it is ineffective, unreliable or too expensive to operate.

      I had a small ‘ah-hah’ experience while reading Implementing sets efficiently in a functional language. Descriptions of binary tree sorting/searching algorithms, such as the excellent Introduction to Algorithms, state that items to be sorted have to be strictly ordered, which means you can’t have duplicates in the tree. But this is easily solved by storing duplicates together in the same binary tree node. “The implementing sets” article suggests adding a ‘count’ field to the node, which marks how many copies are in the node.

He notes that normally, French texts compress at about 60-65% of the original, but the EU constitution compresses at about 75%. He puts this down to “jargon, puffery, redundancy…” in the constitution. I wonder what the US Constitution is (before and after any admendments added after the Bill of Rights). To be determined…

      Jean Veronis has interesting post about the use of abbreviations in an ancient Christian text. He points out that later (medieval) texts had a much higher use of abbreviations, and suggests that perhaps the use of translations for Lord, Jesus, etc., were to mark “membership in a tribe” in addition to compression.
 Ne retrouve-t-on pas là le double besoin qui se fait sentir dans l’écriture “texto” : gagner de la place, sans doute, mais aussi marquer son appartenance à une tribu, à un groupe à part ?
