Silver was described by MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough as an “ideologue” and a “joke” who is biased in favor of Obama; and Silver’s defenders have accused his attackers as, among other things, “innumerate” and “braying idiot detractors.

      US Representative and Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin has been under fire for his use of the expression, “legitimate rape” during an interview about whether abortion should be legal in the case of rape. Akin said:
 First of all, from what I understand from doctors [pregnancy from rape] is really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work, or something.

I’m afraid that This American Life’s focus on its own errors might overshadow the truths about working conditions in China. To their credit, they spend some time trying to get at the facts.
In the final minutes, Ira Glass interviews Charles Duhigg of the New York Times, who has done his own investigation of working conditions at Apple.

      In the wake of the horrible killings in Norway, I saw several tweets and Facebook posts that were something like “Brown: terrorist. White: extremist. Got it.” or “It speaks volumes that the immediate assumption was that this was the work of Muslim terrorists.” In other words, people began quite quickly to comment on the media reaction to the story, criticizing (implicitly or explicitly) for being anti-Muslim. This seemed odd to me, because by the time I started to see stories about the killings, the stories themselves were tentative about what the motivations of the killer or killers were.

First, I think Mr Godin is (perhaps) confusing moral good and monetary achievement.

 Lost in the attention given to Obama’s Internet surge is that only a quarter of the $600 million he has raised has come from donors who made contributions of $200 or less, according to a review of his FEC reports. That is actually slightly less, as a percentage, than President Bush raised in small donations during his 2004 race, although Obama has pulled from a far larger number of donors.

 NEW YORK – The results of an internal Justice Department investigation released today reveal that officials at the highest level of government — including the White House — received reports on the abuse of prisoners in U.S. military custody overseas as early as 2002. Congress called on the department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to conduct the investigation after documents made public through an American Civil Liberties Union Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request revealed FBI agents at Guantánamo had raised concerns about methods used by military interrogators.

      The Detroit Free Press is reporting on a new plan to seat Michigan delegates at the Democratic convention. The idea is to give Clinton 69 regular delegates, and Obama 59. “The proposal also would seat the state’s 29 superdelegates.”
I suspect the hidden (Clinton) agenda is to seat the superdelegates.
Since these superdelegates were responsible for the mess we’re in, it would make more sense to me to split the delegates 64/64 between Clinton and Obama, and leave the superdelegates at home.

I would be remiss, however, if I did not note that there are other costs: in the long run, the squandering of America’s leadership role in the international community, the diversion of attention from critical global issues, including issues like global warming and nuclear proliferation in North Korea—that simply won’t go away on their own, and that cannot simply wait to be addressed—may represent the largest and most longstanding legacy of this unfortunate war.

 Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been an outspoken opponent of torture, often referring to his own experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. In this case he supported the administration’s position, arguing as Mr. Bush did Saturday that the legislation would have limited the C.I.A.’s ability to gather intelligence. So, McCain is in favor of allowing the US to practice such cruel and inhuman punishment and torture as:

      Should Michigan redo its Democratic primary for president?
I think it was shameful, scandalous and grossly stupid that our Governor Granholm, Senator Levin, and the state Democratic and Republican committees disenfranchised Michigan voters.
Millions of dollars were spent holding a sham election in which the only Democratic front-runner on the ticket was Senator Clinton. Her presence on the ballot was itself a masterful bit of triangulation, allowing her to garner votes while not spending any money on campaigning in Michigan and publicly committing to honor the Democratic National Committee’s rules.

 President Robert Mugabe is set to score a propaganda coup with his national day of prayer on June 25 that is to feature pro-Mugabe clerics as well as some who previously opposed the head of state and his ruling ZANU PF party…The aging Zimbabwean leader’s main Christian ally is a man most Anglicans in Zimbabwe say is an embarrassment to their religion, the 56-year old Anglican Bishop of Harare, Nolbert Kunonga.

      From The Mennonite Weekly Review:
 The manuscript of the first protest against slavery in North America — written in Germantown in 1688 by a group that included Quakers and former Mennonites — has been rediscovered more than 50 years after it was last seen. The document was uncovered this spring in the vault at the Arch Street Friends Meetinghouse in downtown Philadelphia, according to Randy Nyce, director of the Germantown Mennonite Historic Trust.

 THERE is no such thing as a “Christian politics.” If it is a politics, it cannot be Christian. Jesus told Pilate: “My reign is not of this present order. If my reign were of this present order, my supporters would have fought against my being turned over to the Jews. But my reign is not here” (John 18:36). Jesus brought no political message or program.

      Once upon a time–back in the early 80’s–I taught English as a Second Language. A number of my students were Bahá’ís from Iran. I remember one student in particular who wasn’t doing very well, and whom I had to ask to come to my office to discuss her academic situation. It turned out that she was very motivated to correct any problems she was having, because if she failed and lost her student visa, she would have to return to Iran, and face the ongoing persecution of Bahá’í believers by the Shia-controlled government.

      Many interesting stats, including:
 White evangelical Christians were solidly behind the president throughout his first term in office, but that support has waned over the past 15 months. Currently, just 54% of white evangelicals approve of the president’s job in office, while 36% disapprove. Bush’s support has also dropped among people who attend church each week or more frequently. According to post-election exit polls conducted by the National Election Pool, these voters backed Bush over Kerry by a 61%-38% margin.

Hmm, the US Census says there are about 105 million households (2000 census data). Let’s round down the budget request to $500 billion, and the household population to 100 million; this means Bush is asking for $5,000 per household.

      The very government itself seems an organized scramble, and Congress a boys’ debating-club, with the disadvantage of being reported. As our party-creeds are commonly represented less by ideas than by persons, (who are assumed, without too close a scrutiny, to be the exponents of certain ideas,) our politics become personal and narrow to a degree never paralleled, unless in ancient Athens or mediaeval Florence. Our Congress debates and our newspapers discuss, sometimes for day after day, not questions of national interest, not what is wise and right, but what the Honorable Lafayette Skreemer said on the stump, or bad whiskey said for him, half a dozen years ago.

      On November 26, four members of the Christian Peacemaker Teams were kidnapped in Iraq by a previously unknown group called the Swords of Righteousness. The CPT team was in Iraq investigating abuses by the occupying forces (they provided some of the first news on Abu Ghraib and other abuse cases in Iraq). Their motto is being “committed to reducing violence by ‘Getting in the way,&rsquo;” which means putting themselves in dangerous spots just so violence may be reduced because of public pressure, changes of heart, putting on spotlight on abuse, etc.

Many, if not most, institutional systems in the United States were explicitly, and without apology, created with racist intentions. Our constitution declared ‘Persons held to Service or Labour’ (that is, black slaves) to be worth only three-fifths of a regular citizen with respect to representation. Educational systems were set up as separate systems for blacks and whites. Housing covenants were written to restrict blacks and other minorities from living in certain neighborhoods.

      Interesting article Why are American presidential election campaigns so variable when votes are so predictable? (pdf) by Andrew Gelman and Gary King. First, I didn’t know that presidential elections were so predictable, but apparently they are (close races are predictably close, not-so-close races are predictably not-so-close) based on certain relatively well-known independent variables. Second, the authors make a good case about why voter polls are so variable. Basically, people eventually gather enough information to make a decision based on their real preferences; and at the point (which is usually near the election).

The measure, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, would require American troops to follow interrogation standards set in the Army Field Manual and bar “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” of prisoners in U.

 By this time [1769] the original colonial designations of “Christian” and “Indian” were giving way to “white,” “red” and, with the increase in slave traffic, “black”: “Color didn’t originate with Indian-white relations but with slavery,” said University of Connecticut historian Nancy Shoemaker. “It is slavery that makes color seem to be a way to organize people.”
 But the original use probably came from Native Americans themselves, says Ives Goddard.

It was Marilyn vos Savant who pointed out that, although flipping a coin ten times and getting ten heads was as likely as any other permutation, if you did see ten heads in a row, you should be suspicous of the coin.

 Although Mugabe is regarded as evil incarnate by Zimbabwe’s Roman Catholic hierarchy, he does have friends elsewhere in the Christian Community. Zimbabwe’s Anglican primate, Bishop Nolbert Kunonga, has used his pulpit at St Mary’s Cathedral in Harare to support Mugabe and his land reform programme.
He was rewarded by Mugabe with one of the farms, St Marnock’s, outside Harare, confiscated from its previous white owner, 25-year-old Marcus Hale.

      I grew up in Roseville, Michigan, an anonymous Detroit suburb of no distinction. It’s among the least beautiful places I’ve ever seen–the homes are non-descript, the businesses are strip-maill ugly. My father still lives there, so I visit it from time to time. One point of artistic light is a funky little studio run by Ed Stross, who has painted a large mural on the side of his building with portraits of Mother Theresa and Princess Diana.

 Indeed, it is not uncommon to find Michiganders who will claim that the speech of national broadcasters is modeled on their dialect. Even a cursory comparison of the speech of the network news anchors with that of the local news anchors in Detroit will reveal the fallacy of such claims.and
  As long as Midwesterners are viewed as average, boring or otherwise nondescript, their speech will be seen through the same prism.

      Michigan went for Gore in 2000, and for Kerry in 2004, by relatively small amounts: Gore got 51.3% of the vote in 2000 (with 2.6% going to 3rd parties). Kerry got 51.1% of the vote in 2004 (with 1% going to third parties).
Voting was up 13.7% over 2000. Most interesting is the disparity between Democrats and Republicans: Democratic voters were up 13.3%, but Republicans were up 18.1%.
It’s interesting to pull out two counties: my own (Kalamazoo) and Wexford, a largely rural county in northern lower Michigan (the county seat is Cadillac, where my sister-in-law Jean and her family just moved–and she immediately jumped into the Democratic get out the vote).

Kerry’s performance was exactly the same as in the first two debates: “presidential,” in a word. CBS’s instant poll of undecideds said a plurality thought Kerry had won the debate.
I could be wrong, but I think this debate shows that the right’s use of “liberal” as a scare word is dying.

      On Thursday, the US briefed reporters on a draft report on the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Although it states that Iraq clearly intended to produce WMD at some point, no significant evidence of WMDs have been found. This is very significant because:
  The US went to war in Iraq citing the immediate danger of Iraq’s WMD program.
  The UN inspection program in Iraq argued that WMDs were very unlikely.

      Ralph Nader visited Kalamazoo today. Among other things, he tolld the audience (according to the Kalamazoo Gazette article) to”vote your conscience.” And, in general, this seems like a reasonable thing to say. But, of course, Nader is only on the ballot in Michigan because the Republican Party passed out petitions for him, because they hope (and not unreasonably so) that this will draw votes away from Kerry. My conscience says not to vote for people who cannot attract enough workers to get on the ballot.
