      Word vectors have become increasingly important in as features in machine learning models for natural language processing. The idea is to represent a word in some multidimensional space (the vector) in which words which are “similar” are similar in that space. Typically, one hopes that word vectors will provide some kind of semantic similarity. A typical party trick is to use word vectors to solve word analogy problems; e.g., king is to queen as man is to ?

      What is Named Entity Recognition? Named Entity Recognition (or NER) is the task of finding all the names of things in a text. For example, in the sentence “Jimi Hendrix played ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at Woodstock,” NER, correctly done, would find the references to “Jimi Hendrix,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and “Woodstock.” Note that NER should also extract names it has never previously seen; for example, in the sentence “Johannes von Smetly is the protagonist in Willard Smith’s new novel”, an NER system should extract “Johannes von Smetly” as a name, even if it it doesn’t appear in any standard name list.

      This interesting article on using Google Ngram data to estimate when new names for world cities overtook their names (for example, “Beijing” instead of “Peking”) makes the following claim:
 “Istanbul” is still less commonthan “Constantinople” more than five hundred years after the the city fell to the Muslims.But I think this is either a bit tongue-in-cheek, or misinformed. Of course, the Ngram data records books discussing any period of history, and I suspect that more is written about historic Constantinople than modern Istanbul.

The later article shows how to use database software (MySQL and its implementation of the SQL language) to do basic Twitter analysis. The ‘basic analysis’ includes counts by hashtag, timelines, and word clouds. They analyse about 475k tweets.
But here’s the thing: all their analyses can be done more simply with simple text files and pipes of Unix commands (as most eloquently demonstarted in Unix for Poets, by Ken Church).

Peter Norvig, one of the co-authors of the culturomics paper and the director of research at Google, was also the co-author on another significant article with the suggestive title, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”. The invention of the term “culturomics” suggests a scientific programme for attacking questions of culture that stresses statistical models based on large amounts of data, a programme that has been very successful both academically and commercially for linguistics and artificial intelligence, to say nothing of the informatics approaches of genomics and proteomics upon which the term culturomics is based.

      Geoffrey K Pullum, in Tweet this, a blog post at the inestimable Language Log, discusses the syntax of the neologism tweet and engagingly writes:
 Twitter merely coined a verb meaning “send a message via Twitter”, but they didn’t specify what linguists call its subcategorization possibilities. They added the verb to the dictionary, but they didn’t specify its grammar. The verb tweet is gradually developing its own syntax according to what it means and what its users regard as its combinatory possibilities.

      I noticed that the expression “avoid like the plaque” showing up in some search results I was doing. This is “plaque” with-a-queue, not “plague”-with-a-gee. This seems like an odd misspelling to me, and I was curious how often this occurs. The Bing Ngram data gives us the tools: given “avoid like the”, the word “plague” occurs 98.68% of the time (in the web body data). The word “plaque” is the second most common word, occurring 0.

Coincidentally, my daytime boss has just conducted an interview with William Morgan–formerly of Powerset, but now at Twitter–about hash tags, in case you want to come up to speed on what they are. It’s a fun read in any case, including the origin story of hash tags.

      I enjoyed reading the Wikipedia page about its “lamest edit wars.” One of these edit wars was whether the article on what Americans call “aluminum” and what Brits call “aluminium” should have, as its fundamental title, “Aluminum,” or “Aluminium.” And, one of the arguments presented in favo(u)r of “Aluminum” was that more Google hits are available for the US spelling than the UK spelling. “Ghits” is notoriously unreliable (as are Bing hits and the other search engines), since the number of search results reported are subject to lots of factors, not of which is tied directly to actual number of documents returned.

      There is a void in the English language which, with some diffidence, we undertake to fill. Every one has been put in an embarrassing position by ignorance of the status of some woman. To call a maiden Mrs is only a shade worse than to insult a matron with the inferior title Miss. Yet it is not always easy to know the facts. When an author puts on the title page of a book Marion Smith, it is not even possible to be certain of the sex of the writer, and it is decidedly awkward for a reviewer to repeat the name in full over and over again.

      It has often been noted that English is deficient because it lacks a third-person pronoun that can refer to any person, without respect to sexual gender. Although some claim that “he” can refer to anyone in sentences like (1), most linguists agree that maleness is much more salient in these cases than a generic sense.

      I got discussing the idea of Gemütlichkeit with a friend today–actually the Danish expression “hygge”–but I was connecting it to Gemütlichkeit–and I made the claim that “homely” used to mean something like gemütlich.
And so it seems: the OED reports several senses of “homely” with gemütlich connotations. For example, “Become as one of the household; familiar, intimate; at home with”, now rare or obsolete. The first citation is from 865 ad.

      America the Beautiful has interesting linguistic properties. In particular, it uses verbs in the subjunctive mood, which is quite unusual in modern English, except in fixed expressions (such as “God forbid.”). The subjunctive is usually used to describe a condition that doesn’t exist, or a condition that one wishes to exist, such as “if I were a rich man.”
The interesting thing about the subjunctive in English is that it often indistinguishable from the simple past tense or a request/command form.

      Google is now using their internal translation software for all language pairs, and my very, very brief look at their results look good. This is very idiomatic, for example:
 I was amused by calculating the number of video tags football (soccer) and rugby on Dailymotion (English pages). No doubt, soccer is more popular than rugby! The original French (from Jean Véronis’s blog):

      Search on the web for “as simple as possible, but no simpler” and the web will tell you that Albert Einstein said this. Einstein said a lot of things, and a lot of things are attributed to him; knowing whether he, in fact, said a particular pithy quote is a bit of a problem.
I spent a good couple of hours this morning tracking this down, and I think that the Wikiquote page on Einsteingets it right.

      There must be an antonym for ‘hype.’ To hype something is to engage in hyperbole about it: Apple products have generated their share of hype. (For example: Steve Jobs said, “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”) I don’t mean ‘anti-hype’ in the sense of telling the approximate truth about something, desengaño or dis-illusionment. But after the IPhone announcement, Steve Ballmer said, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.

One of the many things that it takes for a computer to “understand” text (as we are trying to do at Powerset) is for it recognize names and what they refer to.

I’ve just finished reading (in a translation by RJ Deferrai), an excellent essay On the distinction between ousia and hypostasis. In this letter, he writes very clearly about the Christian view of God as Triune, in particular explaining the meaning of the technical terms ousia (abstract being) and hypostasis (individual being).
It’s good as a piece of theology, but it’s also interesting as clear technical writing.

      Mark Liberman, in his usual engaging way, discusses “the tangled history of a mangled maxim” at Language Log.
It was prompted by a statement in Bush’s State of the Union address: “Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required,” which should be (to be parsable) something like “To whom much is given, of them much is required.”
Liberman notes that this eventually goes back to the New Testament, specifically Luke 12:48, which, in King James’s Engish, is: “For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required.

Unthinking man! remember this, Thou, 'midst thy sublunary bliss, Must groan, and gasp, and die!  I think what is ‘archaic’ (that is, no longer in common use) about the use of midst here is its use as a preposition.

 faith-based (adjective): affiliated with or based on religion or a religious group : a faith-based plan that bilked investors out of millions. USAGE The preponderance of usage for this term today connects it with institutions and programs that are affiliated with an organized religion, and with President George W. Bush’s faith-based initiative, which enables religious institutions doing social work to receive government funding.

      Mark Liberman (to whom I emailed about Zonker’s use of ‘my brave‘), wrote about ‘My adjective‘ on Language Log. As usual, he has interesting things to say. He points out that
 One small issue is that second-person forms like “your idiotic” are homophonous with the corresponding clausal forms “you’re idiotic” etc. But that sort of ambiguity between innovation and conservatism may be an advantage.
 I began to wonder whether complex adjectival phrases will eventually be allowed in “My ___” forms.

I asked the following question on the Linguist List:
 Words like ‘to dial’ and ‘key’ and ‘album’ take on a shifted meaning as the underlying technology changes. Wordnet, for example, still defines ‘to dial’ as something like ‘to enter a telephone number using a dial.’ Of course, most dialing now occurs via push-buttons. Similarly, keys are now often made of a plastic card (or are completely virtual), and an ‘album’ can be a CD.

  Grammar, with its mixture of logical rules and arbitrary use, provides a child with its first exposure to the frameworks for human conduct that will confront it later: law, morality, every system that humanity has devised to order instinctive experience.

      I received an email from Justin Bur that says (quoting with permission):
 Your English version of Borges’ celebrated essay http://www.entish.org/essays/Wilkins.html contains a rather spectacular mistranslation based presumably on a typo in the original Spanish. Section 16 of Wilkins’ taxonomy classifies the *whale*, not beauty, as a viviparous oblong fish. There is a complete text online at http://reliant.teknowledge.com/Wilkins, and the relevant passage is on page 132. The confusion seems to arise from the graphic similarity between “ballena” (whale) and “belleza” (beauty) in Spanish.

 By this time [1769] the original colonial designations of “Christian” and “Indian” were giving way to “white,” “red” and, with the increase in slave traffic, “black”: “Color didn’t originate with Indian-white relations but with slavery,” said University of Connecticut historian Nancy Shoemaker. “It is slavery that makes color seem to be a way to organize people.”
 But the original use probably came from Native Americans themselves, says Ives Goddard.

      Adults can be retrained to learn second languages more easily, says UCL scientist (via Mirabilis.ca). This looks encouraging; still, it’s a small study–the study showed that a study of 63 Japanese ESL students were able to increase their perception of the r/l distinction in English by 18% after 10 sessions. Still, the r/l distinction is notoriously difficult (even native speakers of English end up going for ‘speech therapy’ to learn how to produce the r/l distinction).

      I learned about Copyscape.com today via rebecca’s pocket. Copyscape allows you to tell whether you’ve been plagiarized elsewhere on the web. I checked a number of pages, and found that I was feeling a bit sad that nothing I’d written had been worth plagiarizing … until finally I found that my description of C++ in my Real Quick C++ tutorial showed up at &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.maguma.com/doc/reader.php?docset=sdkdocs&amp;page=oop.html&quot;&gt;http://support.maguma.com/doc/reader.php?docset=sdkdocs&amp;page=oop.html&lt;/a&gt;.

      Much fun about teaching English as a foreign language, as I did in a former life; including a bitter essay that pretty much explains why I stopped teaching EFL.
 After the age of 40, English teachers are burnt-out, skill-less and unemployable, their working lives a wasteland, their future oblivion. Suicide attempts are not unheard of. A former colleague of mine, a charming and talented but fatally lazy Scotsman who was well on his way to drinking himself to death, was recently found in a pool of blood, having tried to finish himself off by slashing his wrists.

      Man o’ man is this cool: interactive chart of name popularity.. The chart here shows the popularity of names starting with LAT; it was interesting to see the decrease in people named ‘Jane,’ (our daughter’s name) over time–it really does seem like an ‘old lady’s name,’ as Jane often complains. No Britneys before the 1970s, or Khalils before the 1980s. (The chart only has data for the 1000 most popular names per decade).

 Indeed, it is not uncommon to find Michiganders who will claim that the speech of national broadcasters is modeled on their dialect. Even a cursory comparison of the speech of the network news anchors with that of the local news anchors in Detroit will reveal the fallacy of such claims.and
  As long as Midwesterners are viewed as average, boring or otherwise nondescript, their speech will be seen through the same prism.

      I remembered a post by Mark Liberman about disambiguation of complex nominals when I visited a doughnut shop today. The post points out that, when trying to determine automatically whether a phrase like “sickle cell anemia” is (say) sickle-type cell anemia or an anemia of sickle cells — i.e., whether it’s [sickle] [cell anemia] or [sickle cell] [anemia]–you can do something very simple, which works very well in practice: count the number of times “sickle cell” and “cell anemia” occur in a large body of texts, and the more frequent is likely to be the right grouping.

Via Yahoo Search: Flub-a-dub was a cast member on Howdy Doody. Flubadubya is a screen name on the Democratic Underground. And, finally, it even shows up in the Bible.

You can find “flub your dub” a couple of times, including this bluegrass song. I assume that ‘flub (your) dub” means make a big mistake; but how did this Southernism get to India?

 We have free speech in this country, and access to a magnificently flexible and expressive language. This power of linguistic expression, granted to our species alone it would seem, is strong magic. We must be very careful what we do with it. This descent into slander and false memory recovery and document forgery and history denial and mutual accusations of cowardice and treachery is not the free discussion of political matters that the authors of the First Amendment envisaged for us.
