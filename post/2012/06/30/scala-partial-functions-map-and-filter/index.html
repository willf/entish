For some reason, I got myself tripped up on some very basic things, and so here are some notes for myself and perhaps for others. (There were some other things going on, for one, support website pagination, but I won’t discuss that here).</p>
<p>The simplest way to handle is to use <strong>filter</strong> and <strong>map</strong> on the collection. For example, let’s say we want to remove, from a collection of integers, all odd numbers, and halve all the remaining numbers if they are a multiple of 4:</p>
<p>scala&gt; (1 to 12).filter{_ % 2 == 0}.map{i =&gt; if (i % 4 == 0) i/2 else i} res43: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(2, 2, 6, 4, 10, 6)</p>
<p>Simple enough, of course: filter, then map, though map then filter might make sense in other cases (but of course here there is less “work” if we filter first).</p>
<p>Another possibility was to use partial functions, using <strong>collect</strong>. This can allow mapping and filtering to take place in the same step. In Scala’s terms, a partial function is a function from only some values of its argument. For example, if a function only applied to even <strong>Int</strong>s, then this function would be partial. This is, in effect,what we are saying the filter step does above. So we <em>can</em> get the same effect using <strong>collect</strong>:</p>
<p>scala&gt; (1 to 12).collect{case i if i % 2 == 0 =&gt; if (i % 4 == 0) i/2 else i} res44: scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[Int] = Vector(2, 2, 6, 4, 10, 6)</p>
<p>It’s a tool to have in one’s toolbox, but I think the “filter, then map” is clearer code. Interestingly, the first version is even a little shorter than the second. <strong>Edit:</strong> But see the first comment below, which clearly explains <strong>collect</strong>‘s value**.**</p>
