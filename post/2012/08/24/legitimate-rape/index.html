<blockquote>
<p>First of all, from what I understand from doctors [pregnancy from rape] is really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work, or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.
His gaffe has been widely dissected. It seems clear now that Akin believes (against all evidence) that pregnancy in the case of violent rape is rare, and this is believed by at least some of his co-religionists. I have to say that I have never heard this from any of my prolife friends, but it wouldn’t surprise me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s clear that Akin meant something like “real rape,” or “what could legitimately be called ‘rape.&rsquo;” It’s somewhat odd to use a positive word, like “legitimate,” to describe a negative thing. I wonder if he got primed incorrectly from the expression “legitimate foul” as used in sports. Players often pretend to be fouled against more strongly that the ase warrants, and referees need to quickly decide whether the foul was “legitimate” and deserving of punishment (note that Akin goes on to talk about punishment in his comments). Many commentators have claimed that Akin (and, by extension, the whole GOP) want to act as the referee.</p>
<p>In Akin’s clarifying remarks, <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/akin-on-legitimate-rape-comment-i-misspoke">he said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In reviewing my off-the-cuff remarks, it’s clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year. Those who perpetrate these crimes are the lowest of the low in our society and their victims will have no stronger advocate in the Senate to help ensure they have the justice they deserve.
It’s also clear from these remarks, I think, that Akin is still carrying an idea of rape with violence as being the only kind of rape that can be legitimately called rape. Rapists are “the lowest of the low;” he might be talking about date rape, but I doubt it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also fascinating to see how Akin’s misstatement has caught so much attention. The attention has moved on somewhat to his invalid scientific ideas and particularly strong line on abortion, but the phrase “legitimate rape” will be how this is remembered. But the misstatement is not particularly egregious; his failure to know basic truths about rape and pregnancy is.</p>
<p>There are those on the left, I imagine, who are pleased to see Akin skewered by his own rhetoric, and perhaps Akin deserves it. It doesn’t take a Freudian to imagine that Akin said “legitimate” and meant “legitimate.” But there must be a way to both honestly and strongly point out that Akin’s real failure is to understand fundamental scientific truths about the matters which he legislates.</p>
