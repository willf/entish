<p>Also, my son Mark has just moved from China and is staying with me this week. He’s looking for a business developer role in California, probably high tech, so if you hear of anything, let me know. After two and a half years running his own wine company in China, he’s ready for his next challenge. (Here is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=10991241">his LinkedIn profile</a>).</p>
