It’s more regular in its core Than pundits, who focus on its more Erratic ways, would have you believe. Perhaps they simply cannot conceive Of any system not based in Latin— They would choose, I suppose, to flatten All writing to “one form, one sound” But, really, regularities abound. Consider, how we pronounce the plural Form of words; Imagine the neural Work of reading “dogs” and “cats.” Would you prefer “dogz”? That’s Not right—that single ess for each Is easier to read, to sound out, and to teach. Or consider “heir/inherit” To write “air” would be a demerit, A signature failure, and a sign Of a spelling system’s worse design. Seriously, it would simply astonish, Anyone to think that “ghoti” sounds like “fish.” Besides, English spans such colossal ages And latitudes, I doubt such cages Desired by fans of regularization Could withstand the normal mutation Of how language really adapts. “Wind” and “hind” have rhymed or not, perhaps, As, over time and place, each has adopted A short I, sometimes a long I, co-opted By real human beings. So “after tea and cakes and ices, “ Let us “force the moment to its crisis”— Haters, they say, are going to hate; let them snivel I have had enough of drivel, Go ahead, enjoy your whine, But English spelling is basically fine.</p>
