<blockquote>
<p>Six lessons from the this singing are available for listening at the following link <a href="http://www.pilgrimproduction.org/sacredharp/john%20lamb/elkhart.html">http://www.pilgrimproduction.org/sacredharp/john%20lamb/elkhart.html</a> Enjoy! A cd of the singing is currently in progress – it will contain roughly 26 lessons from the 60 something that were sung at the singing – including New Monmouth, which is one of my favorite songs from this singing. Sincerely, John Lamb, Harrisson, TN
Included is <a href="http://www.pilgrimproduction.org/sacredharp/john%20lamb/music/02.mp3">Daughter of Zion</a> (mp3), a personal favorite and one that I taught at the recent Berkeley weekly singing.</p>
