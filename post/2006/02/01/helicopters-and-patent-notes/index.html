I was a bit nervous, since I had a major role to play in the demo script, but hadn’t actually been able to practice with the real helicopter. There was a tricky bit where I had to induce a simulated ‘communication fault,’ so the helicopter could respond in a useful way–but it had to be done at just the right time; that is, where a communication fault could occur and be successfully taken care of. But our part of the demo went flawlessly. Rain yesterday, rain tomorrow, but no rain today–although it was a bit cold and we had to wait a bit for the weather to warm up. We flew a five point mission, then a five point mission with different flying/sensing maneuvers, then a fifteen point complex mission, all at NASA’s <a href="http://dart.arc.nasa.gov/">DART site</a>, a disaster training site with towers, a collapsed building, and lots of obstacles and rubble. Kudos to my boss Mike Freed and colleague Robert Harris–and of course to the whole <a href="http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/projects/apex/projectARPteam.php">ARP team</a>, especially Matt Whalley, the project lead.</p>
<p>Early American tunebook compilers came out with a <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~ijs/sn/sn-hist.html">variety of shape note systems</a>, and eventually hit upon the idea of having seven shapes (Sacred Harp, which I usually sing, uses only four). In the past two days, I’ve sung using three different shape note systems. I led two songs from Funk’s Harmonia Sacra at the Berkeley singing last night, and tonight I sang (for the first time) in Santa Cruz. There, we sang some white gospel tunes set in Aiken shapes, and one tune set with Swan shapes, probably from <a href="http://members.aol.com/KTown55/newharppix.html">New Harp of Columbia</a>. The Swan shapes may be the ‘ most readable seven note system ever published,’ but they <a href="http://members.aol.com/KTown55/swanscale1.jpg">sure look strange</a>.</p>
