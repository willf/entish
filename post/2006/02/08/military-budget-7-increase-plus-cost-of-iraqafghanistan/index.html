    <meta name="description" content="According to this article at Military.com, Bush sent a request for $439.3 billion defense budget for FY 2007, a seven percent increase. This does not count the ongoing cost of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which, the article states, currently cost over $80 billion per year.
Hmm, the US Census says there are about 105 million households (2000 census data). Let’s round down the budget request to $500 billion, and the household population to 100 million; this means Bush is asking for $5,000 per household.">
