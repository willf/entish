<blockquote>
<p>Search is in its early days, and natural language is the future of search. But it‚Äôs both difficult to enable natural language search at all, and to do it on a scale like Google is a harder matter still. I‚Äôm not sure I would be ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù about the disruption that natural language search will involve. But I‚Äôm really happy that this discussion about natural language search is now happening among the major players, and that Powerset is helping to push the envelope.</p>
