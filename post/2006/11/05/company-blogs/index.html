<p>What’s that you say, a company can’t have a blog? That there’s no difference between a company blog and a press release? Silly you: Press releases talk about the company in the third person, have an about section, and a media contact. Blogs talk about the company in the first person and allow comments.</p>
<p>And, so you see, the title of this post is to be parsed as Noun+Verb, not Noun+Noun.</p>
