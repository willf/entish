<p>I began to wonder whether complex adjectival phrases will eventually be allowed in “My ___” forms. I began to wonder when I wrote the following in an email to that cooler friend of mine, Ryan, about Liberman’s essay, whinging that Liberman didn’t cite me in his essay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My a tiny bit chagrined not to be acknowledged in the essay but what the hay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, we tried to teach <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/barneypell/168162032/">Steve</a> that using the “My adjective” thing will make him as cool and hip as us. Well, he’s already hipper and cooler than I am, so I guess I mean just Ryan. So when he was ill yesterday, Steve wrote Ryan an email that included “my barf.” Sorry, Steve, that should be <a href="http://phrogz.net/nodes/nauseous.asp">My nauseated</a>.</p>
