<p>Hello all, I’ve put the results of my frequency analysis of the 2005 Denson book tune choices, as recorded in the Minutes and Directory of Sacred Harp Singings for 2005, on the Sacred Harp section of my website: <a href="http://www.entish.org/sh">http://www.entish.org/sh</a> The method was more or less the same: I tried to count just tunes chosen from the Denson book as recorded in the minutes book. It’s not perfect, but it gives a feel for how things are. There are definitely more books turning up at singings; I’d love to do a better job of getting to all these, but I don’t think I’ll be able to, lamentably. On a personal note, 2005 is the first year my name will appear in the minutes book. It gladdens my heart to be numbered among you. Thanks to Chris Thorman for providing data to me. As always, comments and corrections are welcome.</p>
