<blockquote>
<p>Dear …, As you are no doubt aware, on May 1st many people are calling for demonstrations and boycotts in support of fair and just immigration reform. To the extent that you can, I urge you to identify and support immigration reforms that: – allow immigrating families to stay together, – allow immigrants access to necessary health and other human services, and – ensure that immigrants receive fair wages and benefits while maintaining (non-militarized!) security and control of our borders. Best regards, Will Fitzgerald
(Thanks to Mark Nielsen for his prompting to do something in support of fair and just immigration reform).</p>
