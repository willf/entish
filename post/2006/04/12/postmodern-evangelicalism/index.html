For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Postconservatives tend to be impatient with exclusive claims to “the correct interpretation” of the Bible or tradition. Yet they are equally impatient with individualistic reveling in ambiguity that results in relativism. Their interest lies in developing open theological systems rather than timeless frameworks of propositional truths. They do not want to ignore the words of the early English Separatist John Robinson: “God always has more light to break forth from his Word!”</p>
