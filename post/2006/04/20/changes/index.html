<p>I <em>am</em> looking forward to the joys of being in the San Francisco area: this weekend is the <a href="http://fasola.org/sf/goldengate/">Second Annual Golden Gate Sacred Harp Singing</a>, and my friend Khalil Dalal has invited me to go see <a href="http://www.omarsosa.com">Omar Sosa</a> at <a href="http://www.yoshis.com">Yoshi’s</a>.</p>
<p>But still:</p>
<p>Yes, my native land, I love thee, All thy scenes I love them well, Friends, connections, happy country, Can I bid you all farewell?</p>
<p><a href="http://fasola.org/index/L/385b.html">Can I leave you</a>, Far in distant lands to dwell?</p>
<p>Home, thy joys are passing lovely, Joys no stranger heart can tell; Happy home indeed I love thee; Can I, can I, say “Farewell?”</p>
