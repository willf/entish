Because Bess works with peppers, we designed a simple experiment to see which part of an Anaheim pepper is the hottest: the seeds, the flesh, the placenta or the stem. Bess carefully cut a small piece of the flesh and the placenta (she put the stem aside) about the size of a seed for each of us. We each tasted a seed, the flesh and the placenta and marked whether it was mild, a little hot, hot, or very hot. Seed: a little hot, a little hot, a little hot. Flesh: mild, a little hot, mild. Placenta: very hot, very hot, yeeyaw!</p>
<p>So now you know: it’s not the seeds, but the white placenta that holds the seeds that contains the heat.</p>
<p>Oh, and the stems? We’re holding them back for stem cell research. (Sorry, that was Bess’s joke).</p>
