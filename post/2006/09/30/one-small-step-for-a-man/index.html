<p>Update: I should have been a bit more skeptical, I think. At least taken a closer look at the data, which David Beaver has now done in <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003630.html">a post on Language Log</a>. Thanks, David.</p>
<p>Update 2: Mark Liberman <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003645.html">presents more evidence</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My conclusion: Neil Armstrong apparently meant to say “for a man”. And perhaps he produced an unusually rapid performance of the “for a” part, with a brief syllabic /r/ followed by a brief and very weakly de-rhoticized schwa. But it seems much more likely that what he actually said was just what everyone has always heard, namely “for man”.</p>
