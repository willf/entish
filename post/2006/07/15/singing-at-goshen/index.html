<p>It was a very good singing today in Goshen; as Mark Miller has remarked, it’s a bit like singing inside the body of a guitar. Lots of southern singers, a very fierce alto section, excellent food. It was stifling hot–in the high 90’s, I think, and humid–but somehow that was all right. Sam Sommers: we’re going to take a break now, and be sure to try and rehydrate yourselves, and if you can’t do that, at least drink some water. Personal highlight: meeting <a href="http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/">Warren Steel</a> for the first time, and being ask by him to sing on the front bench for a while. I had the pleasure of sitting next to Martha Beverly; I’m sure <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tha<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the pictures will show up soon at her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fasolakazoo/">flickr site</a>. Tomorrow: the Kalamazoo convention!</p>
