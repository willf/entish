<p>It was good–make that great–to be singing at home. It’s hard to believe that it was just a year ago that I led my first tune at a Kalamazoo singing. It was wonderful to sing with Bess and Idy Kiser in the morning and then between David Ivey and Judy Hauff in the afternoon. It was very hot and humid again, and we actually finished a bit early as a result, after everyone had a chance to lead.</p>
