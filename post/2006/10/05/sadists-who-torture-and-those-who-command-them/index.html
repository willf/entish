First, he notes that these people, at the end of the day, must enjoy their work, and thus are worthy of being called sadists, sociopaths, sexual perverts or worse. (This reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Hideous_Strength#Characters_in_.22That_Hideous_Strength.22">Miss Hardcastle</a> in Lewis’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That Hideous Strength<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>But he also notes that their <em>superiors</em> have to either wretchedly compartmentalize their beliefs and actions, or actually share in the sadistic pleasures of torture–and he names names, and makes suggestions.</p>
<p>Because we have (theoretically) a military under elected, civilian control, I must note that the final supervisors of U.S. torturers are the people of the U.S.–that is, Fred Clark, you, me.</p>
