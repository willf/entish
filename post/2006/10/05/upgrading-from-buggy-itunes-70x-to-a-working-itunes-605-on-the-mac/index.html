Use these instructions at your own risk.</p>
<ol>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Deauthorize iTunes 7<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for any purchases made</li>
<li>Download iTunes 6.0.5 installer. I got mine from Apple’s download center, but it appears to be gone now. FileHippo seems to have it: <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_itunes/?1249">http://www.filehippo.com/download_itunes/?1249</a></li>
<li>Place iTunes 7 application in the Trash</li>
<li>Place the file  /Library/Receipts/iTunesX.pkg in the Trash. (there’s another file there, iTunes.pkg. You can (should?) leave it alone).</li>
<li>Run the iTunes 6 installer.</li>
<li>Place the file Music/iTunes/iTunes Library file in the Trash</li>
<li>Duplicate the most recent copy of backed up iTunes Library files in Music/iTunes/Previous iTunes Libraries (it will be something like ‘iTunes Library 2006-09-14’).</li>
<li>Rename this file ‘iTunes Library’ and put it in the Music/iTunes folder</li>
<li>Run iTunes 6, reauthorize any purchases.</li>
<li>Vow never to buy anything more from the iTunes store–it’s ridiculous that Apple’s buggy software could result in one’s not being able to play music one’s purchased from Apple.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you tell which step I did <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do?</p>
