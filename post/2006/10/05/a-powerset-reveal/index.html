<p>Seen in this light, there is enormous room for fundamental innovation in search, as the game has only just begun. I believe we are going to look back 5 to 10 years from now and say: “remember when we used to search using keywords?”. It will take hard work to get there, but that’s what we’re working on at Powerset!</p>
