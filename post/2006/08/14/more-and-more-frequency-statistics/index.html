<ul>
<li>The distribution of frequency to rank is an almost perfect lognormal curve for the 11 years (98% correlation).</li>
<li>I was surprised to see that Liberty (137) has the biggest downward trend over the 11 year period — it’s ‘batting average’ dropped from .514 to .220 from ’95 to ’05. I’m Going Home (282) is the biggest gainer, essentially the opposite of Liberty (from .223 to .581).</li>
<li>The correlation between order-in-the-book and frequency overall is -.21; that is, there is a slight tendency for later tunes to be choosen less.</li>
