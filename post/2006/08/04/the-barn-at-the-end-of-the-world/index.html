It reminds me a lot of the writing of Annie Dillard (who has her own website: ‘<a href="http://anniedillard.com/">The Secrets of the Universe as Decoded by the Unhinged’</a>): essays about mindfulness at the interface between the natural and artificial worlds, as well at the interface of the social and solitary life. O’Reilly has a kind of spiritual eclecticism (not only is she a Quaker Buddhist shepherd, but a former Catholic novitiate) that I find both appealing and a bit scandalous–why is this Quaker/Catholic bowing before a buddha? But it’s a question she asks herself–one thing I find appealing about her is how she approaches spiritual practices with an open but doubtful mind. Also, there’s a lot about sheep-raising; I don’t think I’ll be raising sheep anytime soon, any more than I’d want to raise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Egg_and_I">chickens</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://boundlessgrace.blogspot.com/">Linda</a> for lending me the book.</p>
