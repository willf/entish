I remember reading this when it first came out, or perhaps in a book of essays; and I’m glad I remembered this part correctly, because it’s a story I often tell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a while, I was a little worried about what they would come up with, especially after my father-in-law [who was working with the developer] called to ask how important it was that I be able to use both upper- and lower-case letters. But finally, for a total of about $4,000, Optek gave me the machinery I have used happily to this day.
I just love the idea of asking how important lower-case letters were.</p>
