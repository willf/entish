<p>Named Entity Recognition (or NER) is the task of finding all the names of things in a text. For example, in the sentence “Jimi Hendrix played ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at Woodstock,” NER, correctly done, would find the references to “Jimi Hendrix,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and “Woodstock.” Note that NER should also extract names it has never previously seen; for example, in the sentence “Johannes von Smetly is the protagonist in Willard Smith’s new novel”, an NER system should extract “Johannes von Smetly” as a name, even if it it doesn’t appear in any standard name list.</p>
<p>NER systems typically also provide a classification for the names it extracts; for example, that “Jimi Hendrix” is the name of a person, “Woodstock” is a location, etc. The most standard classification I have used has been PERSON/LOCATION/ORGANIZATION/MISC, but of course it depends on the needs of the application.</p>
<h2 id="general-approaches">General approaches</h2>
<p>NER is typically approached as a sequence tagging task, not unlike <a href="https://willwhim.wpengine.com/2015/05/05/how-to-do-part-of-speech-tagging-machine-learning-oversimplified/">part of speech tagging</a>. The basic idea is to tag non-name tokens as being “outside” the name. Tokens within a name are tagged in some way so that one can tell where a name begins or ends. For example, the BIO scheme tags tokens as beginning, inside, or outside a name. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Jimi/B Hendrix/I played/O at/O Woodstock/B ./O
</code></pre>
<p>The BILOU scheme tags tokens as being beginning, inside, last, outside, or unit. “Unit” means a name that is a single token long. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Jimi/B Hendrix/L played/O at/O Woodstock/U ./O
</code></pre>
<p>With such a scheme, it is easy to then extract the names by filtering based on the tags. Finally, it should be noted that the name classification is often used as part of the token classification; for example:</p>
<pre><code>Jimi/B-PER Hendrix/I-PER played/O at/O Woodstock/B-LOC ./O
</code></pre>
<p>So, with BILOU tagging and four name types, there are 17 possible classifications for each token (4 name times times 4 name tags, plus “outside”). Somewhat surprisingly, in my experience, BILOU tagging outperforms BIO tagging, and putting name types on the tokens works better than a separate classification after tagging is done.</p>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Accuracy at the token level tends to not be especially interesting. The baseline of assigning every token an “outside” tag can have pretty high accuracy rates, depending on the text. Typically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">precision and recall</a> of recognized NEs tend to be more useful, as well as metrics based on these (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score">F1-score</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">ROC-curves</a>, etc.)</p>
<h2 id="methods-and-feature-engineering">Methods and feature engineering</h2>
<p>As with part of speech tagging, there are a variety methods for sequence tagging in NER. The simplest use hidden Markov models or maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs), which are very efficient to run at prediction time. The Stanford NER system uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_random_field">conditional random fields</a>, which provide some improvement over MEMMs.</p>
<p>As with part of speech tagging, however, the real gains are due to feature engineering. “<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/jenny-ner-2007.pdf">The features are more important than the model.</a>” The Stanford NER system, for example, uses bag of word features, word ngram features, and word context features; general orthographic features; prefixes and suffixes; and feature conjunctions. Additionally, distributional features (that is, word clusters, or word vectors) are important as well. (Again, we hope to address word vectors in another essay). In my work, using of gazetteers (that is, specialized word lists) is also important: if you know that “Obama” is a common personal (last) name token in a particular corpus, then that can be helpful.</p>
<p>Feature engineering suggests that the training system should run as quickly as possible, in order to explore different spaces of parameters, which is another reason to prefer simpler modelers over others. It’s quicker to train a max-ent model than a SVM, for example.</p>
