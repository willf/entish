Jeff Shrager pointed his camera at the projector screen, and made iChat full screen. So, I guess I’m talking to myself here. Talk about an echo chamber!

      A ‘forword’ is a word in which all the letters are in alphabetical order, with no repeats. Here are the longest ones I could find, using a particular word list I have on my computer (all six letters):
abhors almost begins begirt beknot bijoux biopsy chimps chinos chintz dehort ghosty
If you allow repeats, there’s also ‘beefily’ and ‘billowy’ (at seven letters).
Backwords are the same, in reverse. The longest are (at seven letters):

Let all mortal flesh keep silence, And with fear and trembling stand; Ponder nothing earthly minded, For with blessing in His hand, Christ our God to earth descendeth, Our full homage to demand.
King of kings, yet born of Mary, As of old on earth He stood, Lord of lords, in human vesture, In the body and the blood; He will give to all the faithful His own self for heavenly food.

 He worked for me writing code to parse RAP System execution code under C++, I worked for him (and Joyce Park) doing webdev using Dynamorph, an unlamented language that preceded JSP and PHP and Ruby on Rails.

Last Saturday morning, my mother-in-law, Jane Oren Wend, died. Today was her burial and memorial service. The service was held at First Presbyerian Church in Kalamazoo, Michigan Wayne Conner read words by Jared (“Jerry”) Wend, her husband who died about three years ago, inviting people to remember, grieve and live in hope.

      This cartoon explains an important fact about hobbies and other activities that require special communication protocols and equipment. You’ll want to make sure that the other people you talk to talk about things you want to talk about and are the kind of people you want to talk to.
I came close to becoming a ham radio operator back in the early 80’s until I realized that what ham radio operators talked about most (at least back then) was ham radio equipment.

      Jules Feiffer began writing children’s books in the early ’90s; his first children’s book, apparently somewhat autobiographical, was The Man in the Ceiling. Lovely wife got it out of the library, and I’ve read it this evening.
The story centers around Jimmy, a boy who isn’t much good in at sports (as a real boy should be), but who can draw cartoons very very well. He’s got a driven father, a forgetful mother who is a fashion designer; an older sister prone to tantrums, and a little overlooked sister prone to being a bit of a pest.
