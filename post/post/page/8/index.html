The last example will create a (global) non-function variable which evaluates to the result of the do_something function at load/compile time; probably not what is wanted.
Just wasted about 4 hours on this (since it was taking a long time, and consumed all the resources on my machine, it was difficulter to debug).

      [Disclaimer: I work for Bing as a senior research software developer, but I do not speak for Bing]
Matt Cutts has a thoughtful follow-up articleon the controversy over whether Bing is copying Google’s search results. There has been a little too much heat and not enough light in the discussion, and I appreciate reflective thoughts, and his shout out to us Bing engineers. Someday, we’ll have forgotten all about this controversy.

Google has accused Bing of cheating, of copying Google’s results (Danny Sullivan’s article which broke the news; Google’s official blog post with the accusation). Basically, Google set up a honeypot of synthetic (that is, unique, non-word) search keys which their results led to specifically selected (i.

      [Note: I got bogged down on reading and reporting on the culturomics paper a little too closely, and this is a reboot.]
Peter Norvig, one of the co-authors of the culturomics paper and the director of research at Google, was also the co-author on another significant article with the suggestive title, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”. The invention of the term “culturomics” suggests a scientific programme for attacking questions of culture that stresses statistical models based on large amounts of data, a programme that has been very successful both academically and commercially for linguistics and artificial intelligence, to say nothing of the informatics approaches of genomics and proteomics upon which the term culturomics is based.

      I’ve now had a chance to read the Science Express article describing “culturomics,” that is, the “Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books,” recently published by researchers at Google and several high-profile academic and commercial institutions. The authors claim to have created a corpus of approximately four percent of all books ever published (over five billion books) and supplying time-stamped ngram data based on 500 billion words in seven languages, primarily English; from the 1500s until roughly the present, primarily more recently.

Along the way, though, we’ve had many joys and normal engagements. Here is a bit of the way life has swung for us this year.
