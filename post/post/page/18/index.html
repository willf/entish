      Bush personally approved meetings to arrange torture, which were led by Cheney.
 If you consider what the government did to be torture, which is a crime according to U.S. and international law, Bush’s statement shifts his role from being an accessory after the fact to being part of a conspiracy to commit.

      See it full size for the best effect, I think: Psalm 131. I made this slide show for worship this past Sunday, using CC photographs from Flickr, and music from Lindsay Phillips. It was prompted by Psalm 131:
Lord, my heart is not lifted up, my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like the weaned child that is with me.

      Bess has this Grand Plan: to canoe the Kalamazoo River from its headwaters (more or less) to Lake Michigan, and to do it in parts. Yesterday, the Grand Plan commenced. She and I drove to the Twin Lakes Campground near Pulaski Michigan, waking the attendants at 10 am, who dropped us off up river. Our river canoeing skills are rusting (well, mine were never very good to start with), but we managed to stay dry.

      Besides what must be a playful reference to a fake invention, the “Sacred Harp of Eloquence,” and a brief mention in a letter to the editor, the first mention of the Sacred Harp in the New York Times comes in a review of Eleanor de al Vergne Risley’s “The Road to Wildcat: A Tale of Southern Mountaineering,” a memoir of her travels; the reviewer says she went to the ‘Appalachian foothills of Alabama and then went on to the mountain country.

      I enjoyed the Golden Gate Sacred Harp Singing this past week in San Francisco, and even managed to record the afternoon session (not a great recording, but not terrible either; the altos were strong, but perhaps not as strong as they sound in the recording). The singing was chaired by Natalia Cecire, who is working on a PhD in English at U.C. Berkeley.
I found a great quotation, by the way, in Natalia’s draft of a MLA presentation she gave, “From Stone Tablet to Pensieve: Media and History in Children’s Fantasy“:

 You protect your arms and hands legs and save your eyes. If you see a blasting cap remember now, don’t touch them. Tell a police or a fireman or whatever it is. Have fun like I do with those (baseball mitt, bat and ball) and not with these (blasting caps!!) Anyone I’ve ever met who is exactly my age in years and grew up near Detroit remembers this with fear.

      Mark “Language Log” Liberman is taking Steven D. “Freakonomics” Levitt to task for either misunderstanding the language of statistics, or the underlying statistics theory itself.
In a blog post, “Medicine and Statistics Don’t Mix,” Levitt tells the story of friends of his who spent $5,000 on Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) — a test for genetic viability of embryos — during fertility treatment. The test came back positive for the possibility of birth defects.

      I talked to my brother Dave on the phone today, and we agreed that we haven’t played basketball in 300 years. But we have a hoop in the backyard, and I’ve decided to try to get ‘good’ at shooting foul shots. The advantage of foul shots, of course, is that you don’t have to move very much.
My first try was abysmal: 11/50. Yesterday was worse: 10/50. Today, almost, but not quite, not terrible: 19/50.
