      Hitchens on the Iowa caucus racket:
I was in Des Moines and Ames in the early fall, and I must say that, as small and landlocked and white and rural as Iowa is, I would be happy to give an opening bid in our electoral process to its warm and generous a
 nd serious people. But this is not what the caucus racket actually does. What it does is give the whip hand to the moneyed political professionals, to the full-time party hacks and manipulators, to the shady pollsters and the cynical media boosters, and to the supporters of fringe and crackpot candidates.

      First mention: 1905 for Franklin Delano Roosevelt:
 Mrs. Valentine Hall has sent out invitations for the wedding of her grand-daughter, Miss Eleanor Roosevelt, to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The ceremony will take place at 4 o’clock, March 14, at 8 East Seventy-sixth Street, the residence of Mr. and Mrs Henry Parish Jr., with whom Miss Roosevelt makes her home. Eleanor and Franklin were fifth cousins, once removed, according to Wikipedia. The first mention of Eleanor was in 1894, in an obituary for her father, Elliott.

      As a followup to my post on the correlation of the popularity of Democratic presidential debate, and the number of words they were allowed to utter, here are the results from last nights debates, using data in the New York Times interactive graph of the Republican candidates’ debate. As before, click on the headers to sort by that column:
The correlation between words and the amount of time they spoke is 97%; the correlation between the Zogby poll and the amount of time they spoke was 84%.

`Worse than Failure posts about a silly function named:

Hah! If I’d written this in Lisp, it would be the much simpler:
remove_special_chars_except_quote&lt;em&gt;ampersand&lt;/em&gt; apostrophe_open_bracket_close_bracket_comma&lt;em&gt;hyphen&lt;/em&gt; full_stop_comma_forward_slash
which is why Lisp is so much better than Any Other Language.
(I tend to write functions that have names that are too long, which is why I thought this was funny. I wonder what the longest function name that I’ve ever written is?

      I had a short article published in our local paper, the Kalamazoo Gazette:
 It was New Year’s Eve, and things were finally starting to go right. Our car had broken down outside Forsyth, Ga., on Christmas Eve, and we had had to hitchhike to northern Florida to visit my mother, leaving our car at a garage for repairs. When we got back to Forsyth, the repair shop declared even more repairs were necessary, and we had to ask my wife’s parents to wire us some money.

      To-day, has been set apart by the State and City authorities as a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God for the mercies which have marked the closing year. It will, according to custom, be generally observed. We have all had abundant occasions for gratitude to God for blessings received at His hands. It is well to make public recognition of His goodness, and public acknowledgement of our dependencies upon Him for life and breath and all things.
