      Great quote from Geoff Pullum at Language Log:
 You know, just between you and me, I sometimes worry that there is a naive view loose out there — most students come to linguistics believing it, and there appear to be some professional linguists who regard it as central and explanatory — that language has something to do with purposes of efficiently conveying information from a speaker to a hearer. What a load of nonsense.

      One year from now, we’ll be electing a new president and voting for new members of Congress. Has our next eight years ever been so predictable?
November, 1998. Hillary Clinton wins the election with a large electoral vote majority, and about 55% of the popular vote, the first woman elected president (with Barack Obama as the first African-American vice-president). Democrats gain control of both houses.
First term. Pull-out from Iraq is slow, deadly and met with unconcern by the American public.

      I like (parts of) this poem, which I found in the “Hutchinson’s Republican Songster, for the Campaign of 1860” on Google Books. The ‘Hutchinson’ is question is a member of the Hutchinson Family, a famous singing family of the mid-1800s. This is from Lincoln’s first campaign for president.

 T.S.

 Harriet Beecher Stowe, wife of Professor Stowe, of Bowdoin College, and the author of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” has received $4,000, as her share of the sales already made of that book. She receives 10 cents on each copy sold, and a Bangor paper says she has been offered $10,000 for the copyright of the book. This is an extraordinary case of good luck or success in authorship in this country.
