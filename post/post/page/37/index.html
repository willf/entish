      [ ]1 Bess bought me a new, light camera for Father’s Day; we hope to use it for daughter Jane’s baptism on Sunday. This is one of the first pictures I’ve taken with it. It’s nice to be in Michigan, if only for the weekend.
Addendum: I wrote the following additional verse to Foreign Lander for Bess:
I’ve been to California, Our fortune for to seek, I sit among the mighty, Though I am mighty meek.

      I went to the top of the Eiffel Tower today. It was pretty crowded, but well worth the wait for the view of Paris. But the coolest thing in my opinion was the apartment the M. Eiffel had at the top. I think I read about this before, but they’ve placed effigies of Eiffel and his daughter Claire entertaining–get this–Thomas Edison, who, in the English translation, is listed as an ‘American physician and inventor.

 Hello all, I’ve put the results of my frequency analysis of the 2005 Denson book tune choices, as recorded in the Minutes and Directory of Sacred Harp Singings for 2005, on the Sacred Harp section of my website: http://www.entish.org/sh The method was more or less the same: I tried to count just tunes chosen from the Denson book as recorded in the minutes book.

      Need to know more about Christianity and its many ‘technical’ terms? holyoffice explains it all to you:
 The Emerging Church: This is a term that refers to churches attended exclusively by white people in their 20s and 30s who have at least one tattoo or body piercing. Their distinguishing characteristics are a refreshing, “up to date” interpretation of Christianity, and a reluctance to directly answer questions. He also explains the code from Vinci:

      Dear Liz,
How we loved you. You were such an example to us when you started the “Bread Box,” a local restaurant and meeting place, to provide nutritious, home-made food inexpensively. And you did it when you were in your late 60’s–as part of your “outward journey” to serve God in the world, which also included your leadership in the local Bread for the World group.
When Yofi, our beloved cat, scratched our new baby’s face out of jealousy, and we had to find it a home, you took Yofi in, and made her fat and happy.

      From The Mennonite Weekly Review:
 The manuscript of the first protest against slavery in North America — written in Germantown in 1688 by a group that included Quakers and former Mennonites — has been rediscovered more than 50 years after it was last seen. The document was uncovered this spring in the vault at the Arch Street Friends Meetinghouse in downtown Philadelphia, according to Randy Nyce, director of the Germantown Mennonite Historic Trust.
