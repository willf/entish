      This interesting article on using Google Ngram data to estimate when new names for world cities overtook their names (for example, “Beijing” instead of “Peking”) makes the following claim:
 “Istanbul” is still less commonthan “Constantinople” more than five hundred years after the the city fell to the Muslims.But I think this is either a bit tongue-in-cheek, or misinformed. Of course, the Ngram data records books discussing any period of history, and I suspect that more is written about historic Constantinople than modern Istanbul.

      I was writing some Scala code which had a long series of somewhat complicated and expensive calculations to make, and in many cases I wanted to log the intermediate calculations. The first version of this code was quite complicated looking, because the calculations of the intermediate values and the logging statements were all intermixed.
But then I realized that I could create a separate object which maintained the state, and which performed the calculations, too.

      Lukas Biewald, the CEO of CrowdFlower, posted an essay called Metrics and Hiring.

He found that referral quality and school quality were the two most predictive indicators. Lukas does not break down his data by gender or age or other demographic classes.

      There is a controversy over “Computational linguistics and literary scholarship.” A paper published at the Association for Computational Linguistics David Bamman, Brendan O’Connor, &amp; Noah A. Smith, “Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters“) has come under criticims by Hannah Alpert-Abrams with Dan Garrette, “Some thoughts on the relationship between computational linguistics and literary scholarship“. The primary criticism has been that the ACL paper fails to cite any literary scholarship past the middle of the last century.

      Well, I didn’t think I’d write another Fibonacci A Day post — but there’s a great fibonacci function that’s defined right in the Scala documents, in their discussion of Streams.
A stream is a standard Scala data structure which is very list like. Recall that a Scala list has two parts, a head and a tail; the head is a value, and the tail is either the special empty list (Nil), or another list.

      I am taking Martin Odensky’s Functional Programming in Scala class, and discovered (or rediscovered) that the Fibonacci function is discussed in SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, the book that Odensky seems to be basing much of his Functional Programming in Scala course on).
Even more interesting is that a Fibonacci function which runs in O(lg(n)) steps is presented — that is, it takes about lg(n) steps to compute the _n_th Fibonacci number, instead of n steps.

      The goal of this series was to come up with a general, efficient fibonacci function that goes beyond the typical computer science introduction. The version we developed is fast, efficient with respect to memory, and general. I’d be glad to hear comments.

 A Fibonacci A Day — Introduction A Fibonacci A Day — Recursive Version A Fibonacci A Day — Special Pi Day Post A Fibonacci A Day — Iterative Version A Fibonacci A Day — Out of Bounds A Fibonacci A Day — Speedy Recursion A Fibonacci A Day — Golden Ration Version A Fibonacci A Day — Memoization A Fibonacci A Day — Benchmarking A Fibonacci A Day — Extending to Negative Numbers A Fibonacci A Day — Fibonacci in O(lg(n)) Steps A Fibonacci A Day — Using Streams and a Fast Memoization Method

      We are now confident that the fast recursive version is the best of the algorithms we have explored — it is fast, and can handle large values of the Fibonacci function.
I haven’t been happy, though, with returning a negative -1 when the function is called with a negative number — this feels like a kind of silent error we were trying to avoid in going to BigInts. Fortunately, it turns out that there is a natural extension of the Fibonacci sequence to negative numbers.
