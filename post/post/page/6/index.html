      The WordPress.com stats helper monkeys prepared a 2011 annual report for this blog.
Here’s an excerpt:
 A New York City subway train holds 1,200 people. This blog was viewed about 6,000 times in 2011. If it were a NYC subway train, it would take about 5 trips to carry that many people. Click here to see the complete report.

      This is a followup to my post Computational lexicography on the cheap using Twitter, but more especially in response to Using off-the-shelf software for basic Twitter analysis.
The later article shows how to use database software (MySQL and its implementation of the SQL language) to do basic Twitter analysis. The ‘basic analysis’ includes counts by hashtag, timelines, and word clouds. They analyse about 475k tweets.
But here’s the thing: all their analyses can be done more simply with simple text files and pipes of Unix commands (as most eloquently demonstarted in Unix for Poets, by Ken Church).

      When I was in junior high school at Burton Junior High School — that is, grades seven and eight — Mr Leroy Herron was a very important man in my life. He was a school counselor, and a coach for the basketball team. He was also the sponsor of the Human Relations Club, a club created to get black kids and white kids like me to learn more about what I now might call anti-racism, but then we mostly called non-discrimination.

      This week, I started as the lead engineer for Wordnik‘s analytics platform. Except I get a little antsy about the term “engineer,” so I asked them to make my title “Lead, Analytics Platform.” It’s a real pleasure to work with the Wordnik team so far–super excited to be working with Tony Tam and Erin McKean, and also former Powersetters Colin Pollack and Robert Voyer. When Robert joined Wordnik over a year ago, I badgered him into getting me an interview–it’s only now that it’s come to fruition.

I remember my Junior High Geometry teacher, Miss Mullens. She was very, very short, kind of shy, but very funny — a classic geek, really, now that I think of it (geek, of course, being a term of praise here, not a negative thing).
Junior High school geometry, for me, was mostly about learning to do proofs — classic Elements of Euclid stuff.

      To implement a bloom filter, you need a bunch of hash functions. In naive implementations (and I’ve seen plenty), programmers pick out, say, five cryptographic hash functions. One problem with this is that the hash functions for bloom filters have different requirements than hash functions for cryptography–the latter tend to be more than is required for the former. What you want for bloom filters is something that’s very, very fast, while maintaining that basic desiderata for bloom filter hashing, uniform spread.

      Daniel Tunkaleng wrote an interesting blog post, “Retiring a Great Interview Problem” on an interview problem that he has, in the past, posed to interviewees, but which he has now retired, because someone posted the problem, and a solution, to an interview problem website. The problem is the segmentation problem (which he calls the word-break problem): given a string, segment it into reasonable words, if possible (for example, breaking “applepie” into “apple pie”).

      In the wake of the horrible killings in Norway, I saw several tweets and Facebook posts that were something like “Brown: terrorist. White: extremist. Got it.” or “It speaks volumes that the immediate assumption was that this was the work of Muslim terrorists.” In other words, people began quite quickly to comment on the media reaction to the story, criticizing (implicitly or explicitly) for being anti-Muslim. This seemed odd to me, because by the time I started to see stories about the killings, the stories themselves were tentative about what the motivations of the killer or killers were.

      Here’s a problem I faced at work: determine the effective top level domain of a URI, using the data from the Public Suffix List, but not using any data structures read into memory (ie, a dynamically created hash table or even a static array). For example, the effective top level domain of “http://blog.entish.org” is “entish.org”, because it is a name one could register.
So, there are about 4000 “positive” rules and about 100 “negative” rules.
