      Fun Peter Norvig post on using randomized techniques to listen to a particular song on an iPod shuffle: Doing the Martin Shuffle (with your iPod). The ‘Martin’ of the ‘Martin Shuffle’ is Charles Martin. Charles was the 2nd grad student of Chris Riesbeck‘s to graduate; I was the 3rd. We both did NLP research, and Charles was my boss for two days (if I remember correctly) when I joined “Intell/Agent Systems,” which now seems like a long time ago.

      I received an email from Justin Bur that says (quoting with permission):
 Your English version of Borges’ celebrated essay http://www.entish.org/essays/Wilkins.html contains a rather spectacular mistranslation based presumably on a typo in the original Spanish. Section 16 of Wilkins’ taxonomy classifies the *whale*, not beauty, as a viviparous oblong fish. There is a complete text online at http://reliant.teknowledge.com/Wilkins, and the relevant passage is on page 132. The confusion seems to arise from the graphic similarity between “ballena” (whale) and “belleza” (beauty) in Spanish.

I was amused to see The Canterbury Tales listed at 38–that’s an impressive back list.

      CNN.com – Senate ignores veto threat in limiting detainee treatment
 Setting up a possible veto showdown with the White House, the Senate voted overwhelmingly for an amendment to a Pentagon spending bill that sets standards for the treatment of prisoners in U.S. military custody. The measure, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, would require American troops to follow interrogation standards set in the Army Field Manual and bar “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” of prisoners in U.

      Is this a potential solution to the production of hydrogen-fueled cars? Danish Researchers Reveal New Hydrogen Storage Technology. What are the possible pollution side-effects?
 In the process described in the article, ammonia (NH3) is produced as an intermediate step. The biggest challenge of this technology is creating a safe fuel tank that can hold ammonia, which can be harmful or fatal to people and animals in the vehicle, because: NH3 is immediately toxic at 500 ppm, NH3 reacts with water, producing ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), producing a lot of heat (‘exothermic reaction’) which could (say) blow up the car, NH3 is very cold when it is vaporized.

Confronted by mystery-and at the same time aware of the virtually constitutive power of words for us-we have tried incessantly to address that which is concealed by mystery, and influence it with our words.

      “Stafford” is a tune in the Sacred Harp. It’s a pretty tune, I think. It is periodicially the proximate cause of discussions on the Sacred Harp mailing list because of the lyrics to which it is set in in the Sacred Harp:
See what a living stone The builders did refuse, Yet God hath built His Church thereon, In spite of env’ous Jews.
The sticking point is, of course, the last phrase: “envious Jews.
