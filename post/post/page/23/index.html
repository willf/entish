      I was reviewing a Wiki project, Wikicompany.org, today. Its stated mission is be a “free, worldwide business directory that anyone can edit,” in the same spirit as Wikipedia. I thought it might be a good resource for company names and facts.
But then I noticed that the vast majority of edits in the past sixty days are about the vast conspiracy behind 9/11 and the new world order. The original 9/11 start page says it’s being done by “the Dutch cooperation to find out the truth behind the events relating to 9/11/2001.

      Google is now using their internal translation software for all language pairs, and my very, very brief look at their results look good. This is very idiomatic, for example:
 I was amused by calculating the number of video tags football (soccer) and rugby on Dailymotion (English pages). No doubt, soccer is more popular than rugby! The original French (from Jean Véronis’s blog):

      David G. Lockwood has died, reports the Linguist List.
David Lockwood was one of my professors when I did my degree in linguistics at Michigan State in the 70’s. He was (and remained, I think) an adherent of “stratificationalism,” a kind of constraint-based network theory of language. His classes were the closest I had to mathematical (remember, this was in the heyday of symbolist linguistic theory). I also took historical linguistics, structural (descriptive) linguistics and phonology from him.

Over at the Powerset blog, Jim Kellerman is talking about Powerset’s use of Hadoop and development of HBase, an open-source replacement for Google’s BigTable.
If you have any idea what ‘Hadoop’ or ‘BigTable’ or ‘HBase’ are, it’s worth checking out.

 Desultory suggests a shifting about from one thing to another that reflects a lack of method: a desultory conversation. Pronounced: deSULtory. This is one of those words I thought I knew, but I didn’t when I actually looked it up. It’s a good word to describe this weblog.

      One of my wackier predictions is that in the future, everyone will wear bike helmets. Obviously, not like current bulky bike helmets, but just as today it is almost unthinkable for someone to ride a bike without a helmet (at least for some people), I have been claiming that someday it will be almost unthinkable for to go outside without some kind of protection against impacts.
Well, it looks like my wacky dream may be coming true!

      Search on the web for “as simple as possible, but no simpler” and the web will tell you that Albert Einstein said this. Einstein said a lot of things, and a lot of things are attributed to him; knowing whether he, in fact, said a particular pithy quote is a bit of a problem.
I spent a good couple of hours this morning tracking this down, and I think that the Wikiquote page on Einsteingets it right.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      There must be an antonym for ‘hype.’ To hype something is to engage in hyperbole about it: Apple products have generated their share of hype. (For example: Steve Jobs said, “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”) I don’t mean ‘anti-hype’ in the sense of telling the approximate truth about something, desengaño or dis-illusionment. But after the IPhone announcement, Steve Ballmer said, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.

      Jonathan Coulton is “a musician, a singer-songwriter and an internet superstar.” He wrote a sweet, goopy song called Code Monkey that I like, as well as a song about the Mandelbrot set. But he also wrote a song called “The Future Soon.” It it, the protagonist sings:

 Q. Did your predecessor or Bob give you any advice when looking through the responses? A. My predecessor stared me in the eyes and warned me that reading too many captions in one sitting could make a man crazy. Oh, and also to “pick the funny ones.” Q. After a while isn’t it difficult to decide what’s funny?
