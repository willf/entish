      According to this Salon article:
 On a tape recording made on Feb. 28, 1973, Dean can be heard telling Nixon that Felt was “the only person that knows” details that had been leaked to the Post. Dean later rejected the notion; in an electronic book published by Salon in 2002, he said he didn’t think there was “any way Felt could have been Deep Throat.”

      When I was a student at Michigan State University, I was involved in Inter-Varsity Christian Fellowship. I went to IV programs at Cedar Campus in northern Michigan several times, once for an entire month for a summer leadership training program, at which both John R. Stott and Edmund Clowney were speakers. Dr. Stott was first–droll, academic, serious teaching from Paul’s letter to the Ephesians. Then Dr. Clowney spoke–on the Sovereignty of God.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      It appears that the Washington Post is confirming that Mark Felt was Deep Throat. The Watergate hearings and Nixon’s resignation dominated the news the summer between high school and college for me, so Watergate coverage always has a special coming of age tinge for me.
For some reason–probably because I’ve never liked him much–I’m also glad that none of John Dean’s five possible candidates for Deep Throat was Mark Felt.

Roger writes an “occasional column” called “Educational Outrage. He talks about the press reaction to some comments he made about the pedagogy to be used at Trump University in [Is Trump Academic?][3]

More evidence that Bush et al. cooked the evidence for WMD in Iraq:
 …Bush said in his Jan. 28, 2003, State of the Union address that Hussein was working to obtain “significant quantities” of uranium from Africa, a conclusion the president attributed to British intelligence and made a key part of his assertion that Iraq had an active nuclear weapons program.More than a year later, the White House retracted the statement after its veracity was questioned.

 As the Class of 2005 goes out into the world, I ask you to embrace this tradition of service and help set an example for all Americans. As Americans we share an agenda that calls us to action — a great responsibility to serve and love others, a responsibility that goes back to the greatest commandment.
