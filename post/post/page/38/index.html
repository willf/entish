      What is the equivalent of testosterone for geeks? I mean, besides testosterone? I went to the Nutch meeting at the Rite-Spot Cafe (a delightfully greasy spoon not far from my house, actually), and sat around a loud, long table with (fellow) geeks talking about search and map-reduce and clusters and regression testing and spidering. The noise level became VERY LOUD and so I left to come home and sleep (though I’m writing this instead).

      We attended the memorial service for Esther Chistophel this weekend. What a lovely service, and we learned a bit more about her last days and hours. She went to a hospice, where family and friends were welcomed. She was attended by most of her extended family. On her last day, several family members came to sing at various times. So did our pastor’s wife, Leanell, whom Esther love to hear sing.

      I want to record the passing of two dear friends.
Ruth Christophel was a very dear woman, the oldest and sweetest person in our small Mennonite church, the wife of the founding pastor. She lived a long full life, and desired to go home to be with Jesus.
Esther Chistophel was a good friend to many, including Bess and me: we almost always sought her out for a word or two at church services, because she was so kind and loving and interested in the world around her.

      Yahoo! has announced a new rev of the Yahoo! User Interface library. I’ve already thought of an innovative use for the windowing controls, which must remain sekrit for now. Safari died a spectacular death when testing out the AutoComplete feature, though. I guess that’s one reason they’re still calling it a beta test. I really wish I’d had this library available when I did the NASA mission planning interface.

      Extremely surprising article at über-evangelical Christianity Today: Messy Revelation: Why Paul would have flunked hermeneutics by historian and biblical studies expert Susan Wise Bauer. It’s a very positive review of a book by Peter Enns titled Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament. Enns argues that the New Testament writers interpreted the Hebrew scriptures in the writers’ own social and cultural context–the writers had come to believe in Jesus as the resurrected Messiah, and then found evidence in the scriptures.

      San Francisco has always been a favorite city. It has so much beauty, both natural and man-made, and the natural and the man-made coexist so well. The great symbol of this is, of course, the Golden Gate bridge, its beautiful symmetry linking the city to the glories of Marin County, rising above the bay, perhaps enveloped by clouds.
This is the first time I’ve lived in the city, though, and I think what has struck me most has been the people–there are lots of ’em, and many different kinds.

      Renkoo has officially gone into “beeta” status. Renkoo is social webware(*) that helps people get together for fun or whatever. Good luck, Renkoo! My friend Joyce Park’s giving me a fetching black and pink tee-shirt has nothing to do with this shout out–I’m much too old to shout out (or, I suppose, wear black and pink).

      I’ve been enjoying listening to Spanish radio out here in California, partly to practice my Spanish, partly because I’m about to live in a latino neighborhood, partly because I’m really grooving on the tuba sounds played during Piolín por la Mañana as I’ve been driving around.
With the talk of new immigration laws in the air, some immigration activists are calling for a ‘stay-at-home’ protest on May 1. I’m starting my new job then, so I don’t think it would be wise to not go to work on my first day… But it did encourage me to write to my US representative and senators:
