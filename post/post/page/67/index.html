      According to this Reuters article, the House and Senate have agreed to spend an additional 82 billion dollars on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, bringing the total to around $300 billion.
According to my reckoning, that’s over $5,500 for every man, woman and child in Iraq and Afghanistan.

      From a secret Downing Street memo written in July, 2002 (eight months before the war began):
 The Foreign Secretary [Jack Straw] said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.

      Last night for some reason–probably because we stopped using our humidifier since Spring allegedly arrived–my nose started bleeding. And bleeding. And bleeding. After 45 minutes or so, Bess took me into the emergency room, where, thanks to the state of American medicine and good health insurance, I left after a couple of hours with a Rhino Rocket up my nose. I look like a booger Borg. I don’t think I’ll be posting pictures.

      My favorite section of the proposed EU Constitution (not that I’ve read much at all):
 Without prejudice to the unified spelling of the name of the single currency of the European Union referred to in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe as displayed on the banknotes and on the coins, Latvia and Hungary declare that the spelling of the name of the single currency, including its derivatives as applied throughout the Latvian and Hungarian text of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, has no effect on the existing rules of the Latvian and the Hungarian languages.

      On advice from Rob Harris, I went to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Unfortunately, I only had about an hour to visit, since the musuem doesn’t open until 11:00 am, and I had a flight out in mid-afternoon. Still, it was a wonderful hour, well spent enjoying the gestalt of the musuem, famously controlled by Gardner’s will to neither add nor subtract from the musuem’s holdings. The courtyard is delightful; it, and the sight of a stained glass window as I turned a corner, both made me gasp.

      I’ve been in California for work, and I got to play a bit too–I sang at the first annual San Francisco Sacred Harp singing on Saturday, and I went to Yoshi’s jazz club in the evening. At the Sacred Harp convention I met Mary McDonald-Lewis, who came down from Washington state to sing. It turns out I’ve heard her voice before–she’s the voice of GM’s OnStar in-car voice recognition system. There’s a great fun MP3 of her demoing her voice on her website at marymac.

      While poking around as I created my previous post, I discovered that the LaTeX sources for printing algorithms in the style used in Introduction to Algorithms is available from Thomas H. Cormen’s website. Below are examples of an insertion sort algorithm typeset using Cormen’s style, and the same algorithm typeset using the standard “algorithm” package. Which do you like better?
