      I’m pretty sure that this Freakonomics article is in error. Previously, Steven Levitt estimated that the odds are about 10,000 to 1 against being arrested for soliciting in Chicago. But here he marvels at an unlucky patron who was arrested twice in the span of about a week. It was Marilyn vos Savant who pointed out that, although flipping a coin ten times and getting ten heads was as likely as any other permutation, if you did see ten heads in a row, you should be suspicous of the coin.

      I’ve just installed Tiger — Mac OS 10.4.1. Things seem pretty stable right now. I really like Spotlight, the full text search feature, although I would really appreciate it if Apple would document the search syntax. The Dashboard doesn’t thrill me, although I am posting this to my weblog through a Dashboard widget.
By the way, I will continue posting only ever so often; my father is ill and has taken a turn for the worse.

      I attended the 2005 International Lisp Conference at Stanford, and presented a paper (abstract; the whole thing) on our work at NASA on using Lisp as the substrate of our autonomy software, Apex. I was surprised that the conference lasted for four days. But it made more sense once I arrived: I think people who like Lisp feel somewhat embattled, and this conference is an opportunity to lick wounds and recuperate and not feel the need to justify the use of a nearly 50-year old language.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Adults can be retrained to learn second languages more easily, says UCL scientist (via Mirabilis.ca). This looks encouraging; still, it’s a small study–the study showed that a study of 63 Japanese ESL students were able to increase their perception of the r/l distinction in English by 18% after 10 sessions. Still, the r/l distinction is notoriously difficult (even native speakers of English end up going for ‘speech therapy’ to learn how to produce the r/l distinction).

      I’ve done an analysis of how frequently hymns from the Denson book were chosen during annual singings in 2004 (as recorded by the Sacred Harp Minutes book).
I tried to be careful to count only selections from Denson. I didn’t look at choices from singings specifically listed as Cooper Book or ‘mixed’ singings. I used a semi-automated process to do the counting.
Perhaps the most interesting difference between the 2002 frequencies is the apparent strong effect of Cold Mountain — 282, I’m Going Home, is was the most chosen tune in 2004.

      Döner kebab – Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
 A variation on the döner kebab known as a Donair was introduced in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in the early 1970s. A restaurant called The King Of Donairs claims to have been the first to serve this version in 1973. The meat in this version is sliced from a loaf made from a combination of ground beef, flour or bread crumbs, and various spices, while the sauce is made from evaporated milk, sugar, vinegar, and sometimes garlic.
