      We all hate clichés. As this article on avoiding clichés from the Oxford Dictionaries says, they’re not always possible to avoid.
Here are some clichés used in the article’s text. These are not examples they give, but clichés they use in the body text:
 Once you’ve spotted a cliché… they’ve lost their impact [they’ve] become stale Some people just tune out make a point [they may miss the point that you’re trying to make] use [something] as a starting point indispensable advice  At least they didn’t say “avoid clichés like the plague,” the clichéd anti-cliché joke.

      I have 100,000 tweets which were sent on 25 March, 2010. Of these, 2,522 had a token which matched the pattern ‘tw_t[_]’, which collected forms like ‘tweeted’ and ‘twittered’ (and forms like ‘twentysomething’ and ‘twilight’). I scanned these and found twenty examples of relatively clear uses of a past tense form of ‘tweet’ or ‘twitter’ (as a verb); there were only 21 of these. Of these 21, 20 where ‘tweeted,’ and the other was ‘twittered’ (It was actually ‘twittrd’, but I take that to be a mispelling).

      Geoffrey K Pullum, in Tweet this, a blog post at the inestimable Language Log, discusses the syntax of the neologism tweet and engagingly writes:
 Twitter merely coined a verb meaning “send a message via Twitter”, but they didn’t specify what linguists call its subcategorization possibilities. They added the verb to the dictionary, but they didn’t specify its grammar. The verb tweet is gradually developing its own syntax according to what it means and what its users regard as its combinatory possibilities.

      Let’s say you want to investigate the use of “tweet” as a verb (see “Tweet this” at Language Log), and you want to collect, oh, 10,000 examples or so and do some concordance work, for example:
This is simple to do with a bash command line, perl, Ruby, the Tweetstream gem, and a spreadsheet program (or just plain old grep).
To download 10,000 tweets containing “tweet,” “tweets”, or “tweeting” and save them in a file called “tweet.

Well, with the Bing Ngram data, we can provide more exact figures which don’t depend on all of the choice and ranking decisions made by a search engine to include or not a page in a result, and (in particular) the estimate of the number of pages on which the term appears.

      The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life released a report on how much Americans know about some religious facts; they have a online quiz version of their survey that’s making the rounds.
NPR reported on this in their story “Survey: Atheists, Agnostics Know More About Religion Than Religious,” and the LA Times did as well in their story “Atheists, agnostics most knowledgeable about religion, survey says.” For some reason, the actual report from the Pew Forum is unavailable as I write, but much of the details can be found at the online quiz.

It’s a little harder to get statistics for this based on the public Bing data, which only goes to four tokens. But here are the most common following words for “nip in the ___”:
bud:46.79%, air:45.60%, h: 2.53%, butt: 1.05%, taste: 0.95%, form: 0.
