      Sitting down to dinner, I said something like today I wrote a program that wrote a program, and its running righ now. Daughter and wife looked slightly alarmed, and dear wife asked if there were any chance that I was working myself out of a job. I said I didn’t think there was much chance that the coming robot wars were about to begin. Getting back to my computer later, I saw this on the console:

      Sunday evening, Bess, a number of friends, and I went to hear Calvin professors Kelly Clark (philosophy) and Steve Matheson (biology) speak on “God after Darwin, Dawkins, and Dennet” at the Church of the Servant in Grand Rapids. Kelly has been a friend of Bess’s since high school, and Susan Ford Clark, Kelly’s wife, shared an apartment with Bess their senior year–in fact, Kelly and Susan, and Bess and I, were married on the same day in the same church (at different times).

      My dad loves to vote. He once paid to take a taxi just so he could vote in a local school election. He was very disappointed that he couldn’t vote in Michigan’s last gubenatorial race, so we worked hard on getting him registered in Kalamazoo township, where his nursing home is. Well, mostly this was done by Amy, the social worker at his nursing home, Tendercare of Westwood.
In turns out that it’s a school election that will be Dad’s first Kalamazoo-area vote.

       The uniqueness and immense pragmatic convenience of proper names in our language lie precisely in the fact that they enable us to refer publicly to objects without being forced to raise issues and come to agreement on what descriptive characteristics exactly constitute the identity of the object. They function not as descriptions, but as pegs on which to hang descriptions (Searle).

      On the Fasola discussions list (a list for discussions about the history and practice of shape note singing), I wrote the following paragraph about a crooked ‘singing master’ (that is, a 18th or 19th century singing school teacher):
 On the other hand, I did recently read (in the Historic Missouri Newspaper Project online archives) a warning advertisement for one singing master who was a shyster and who absconded with funds collected for the school and for printing flyers, etc.

      I used the term ‘shyster’ in a post on a mail list, and someone thought it derogatory. Looking into it, I agree; I apologized and will not use it in the future. Others want to discuss whether it is or not derogatory; here’s a place to discuss this.
I reserve the right to remove comments that are or approach hate speech.
