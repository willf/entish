A response to “Faux Friendship,” by William Deresiewicz 1
Deresiewicz decries social networking sites, especially Facebook, especially in the way that relationships between users of Facebook are called “friends.” Writing a status message is “like pornography.” We have no time for stories. Our relationships are commercialized. We are overwhelmed with the number of false friends. Facebook “seduces” us. It’s a “mirage.” Facebook friends are simulacra of friends.

 Press the ‘Create a Filter’ Enter the domain in the ‘From’ field Select the ‘Never send it to Spam’ option  And, hey presto: it’s been whitelisted.

      It was fun to review the world’s longest logogol (or palindrome) on Peter Norvig’s website today. A logogol is a word or phrase that has the same letters going forwards or going backwards. I think it’s cool that “logogol” is itself a logogol.

 As I did for tweet, I downloaded tweets from Twitter; I just looked for occurrences of ‘texted. Not surprisingly, it was harder to find examples of texted than tweet[ed], but I did find a fair number of examples in a short time.
