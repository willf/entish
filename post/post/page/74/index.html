        Bush-Kerry Debate (II)

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Watching this debate, I found myself much more interested in the horserace–who was winning? who was losing? It seemed clear to me that the President was on the defensive; he even sounded desparate to me (although he seemed to calm down during the last 20 minutes or so). Kerry seemed, well, presidential and wise. Both candidates wandered off a little too often and a little too far from the questions they were asked–but this is a problem that’s bothered me for 30 years or so.

      A followup on post about searching for ‘vice presidential debate’, which Tim commented on.
First of all, I really wasn’t complaining about (say) Yahoo Search’s lack of results from the 2004 debates–it was just odd and a bit disorienting to be thrown back to 2000. I even clicked on an audio stream of the debate and got a ‘this stream is no longer available’ error message–it was then that I realized this was a link for the 2000 Lieberman-Cheney debate.

      I didn’t know about FactCheck.org before the debate, and before Cheney mentioned it (and erroneously called it FactCheck.com, which, apparently overnight, is now a link to a George Soros site). It’s a very useful, non-partisan site set up to check the claims made by politicians. They have a great essay on why it’s legal for politicians to lie to us.

      Gwen Ifill asked Edwards, “What qualifies you to be a heartbeat away?” Cheney’s follow-up was interesting:
 FILL: Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds.
CHENEY: You want me to answer a question about his qualifications?
IFILL: That was the question.
CHENEY: I see.
Well, I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president. Different presidents approach it in different ways.
When George Bush asked me to sign on, it obviously wasn’t because he was worried about carrying Wyoming.

      It’s interesting that as I’ve searched for sources for the vice presidential debates tonight, I’m getting a lot of hits from the debates (both presidential and vice presidential) from 2000. I guess this has to do with “page rank,” but it seems odd. This CNN link, for example, was the fifth link on Google for ‘vice presidential debate. Four out of the top five results for ‘vice presidential debate’ from the beta search engine snap, as well as Yahoo search were from the 2000 election.

      Initial reactions: Today, I’m optimistic about America. Our local paper reports that about 96% of Michigan residents who could register to vote, have registered to vote. It’s clear that this election has stirred interests in and emotions about the political life of our country in ways that haven’t happened in a long time. The candidates were clearly different (as in the first presidential debate) and each gave a ‘very good and forceful presentation of themselves’ (as I just heard on the radio).

      According to Bruce Schneier, the Bush adminstration wants to put RFID tags in our passports.
 Unfortunately, there is only one possible reason: The administration wants surreptitious access [to the broadcast information on the passports] themselves. It wants to be able to identify people in crowds. It wants to surreptitiously pick out the Americans, and pick out the foreigners. It wants to do the very thing that it insists, despite demonstrations to the contrary, can’t be done.
