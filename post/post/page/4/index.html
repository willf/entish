      It would be nice to have an IDE while writing Scalding code, to do syntax checking and method suggestion. I was able to get sbt, Scalding, and IntelliJ to work reasonably nicely together. Here are some notes on this, so you can too.
Build file Add the following to your sbt build file (of course, you may want to add additional dependencies or initial commands):
Plugins You’ll also want to use the excellent sbt- plugin, so add this to projects/plugins.

      It’s been a while since I thought about Paul Graham’s essay, Revenge of the Nerds, in which he highlighted the advantages Lisp has over other programming languages, or the essay Eric Kidd wrote, Why Ruby is an acceptable LISP, in which he highlighted features of the Ruby language that made it “acceptable” to use as a Lisp replacement.
Wordnik made the transition from Java to Scala before I joined them, and at least in my early days there, it seemed like the question was “Why Scala is a better Java.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The origin of pumpernickel is relatively clear — the first part, at least, derives from the onomatopoeic German word Pumpf, or fart (Anatoly Lieberman has an interesting column connecting to pimp, and pimp to the history of faggot).
But there is a folk etymology that tells this story: when Napoleon was marching through Westphalia, he was given some of their rough, dark bread, and he said it was only “bon pour Nicole” — good for Nicole, his horse.

      Slate has a review of a new book with the obscure title 10 PRINT CHR$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO 10, and this brings back such memories of typing in games from Basic Computer Games. The Basic program above prints (forever) as seen in this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo.
The magic here is that the computer is printing either a left or a right angled line character over and over; this looks like a maze.

      I am glad that Natalia Cecire has published a commentary — The passion of Nate Silver (sort of) — on the recent attacks and counter-attacks on Nate Silver’s predictions for the upcoming presidential debate on his New York Times hosted blog, FiveThirtyEight. Silver was described by MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough as an “ideologue” and a “joke” who is biased in favor of Obama; and Silver’s defenders have accused his attackers as, among other things, “innumerate” and “braying idiot detractors.

I’ll still be working for Wordnik — thank God and Tony Tam — but mostly working remotely. I’ll be coming to California once a month, as I have done in the past prior to working for Wordnik.
Also, my son Mark has just moved from China and is staying with me this week.

      I’ve been working with the Dispatch library for Scala over the past couple of days. This is a library for “library for asynchronous HTTP interaction,” and it’s a wrapper for a similar library in Java. It’s been a little tricky to learn — the documentation could be better — and it seems useful to take down a few notes. First, though, it’s worth noting that you need to understand both the 0.

      US Representative and Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin has been under fire for his use of the expression, “legitimate rape” during an interview about whether abortion should be legal in the case of rape. Akin said:
 First of all, from what I understand from doctors [pregnancy from rape] is really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work, or something.
