<p>This is contra a claim in <a href="http://archielevine.blogspot.com/2008/11/traditional-marriage-perverts-tradition.html">“Traditional Marriage Perverts the Tradition of Marriage</a>,” that the phrase was invented in 2004. I notice that a commenter also notes a book by this title in 1896.</p>
<p>(This is just a counter to this particular claim, not the overall argument presented there).</p>
