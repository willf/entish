    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Like <em>tweet</em>, <em>text</em> follows the pattern of verbs called “verbs of instruments of communication” in Beth Levin’s book, <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=3630888"><em>English Verb Classes and Alterations: A Preliminary Investigation</em></a>. In Levin’s inventory, these verbs include</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cable e-mail fax modem netmail phone radio relay satellite sign semaphore signal telecast telegraph telephone telex wire wireless</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I did for <em>tweet</em>, I <a href="http://willwhim.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/computational-lexicography-on-the-cheap-using-twitter/">downloaded tweets</a> from Twitter; I just looked for occurrences of ‘<em>texted</em>. Not surprisingly, it was harder to find examples of <em>texted</em> than <em>tweet[ed]</em>, but I did find a fair number of examples in a short time. In sum, like, <em>tweet</em>, <em>text</em> is a “radio” verb.</p>
<p>To show this, I will present each of Levin’s “properties” of radio verbs, along with her example verb <em>cable</em> side-by-side with <em>text</em>; and then several examples of <em>tweet</em> used in this way. There are two <em>negative</em> properties which requires further discussion.</p>

        @Kirsty_Jedward I just texted you the answer to this question LOL
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        RT @rainnwilson: Brett Favre texted me explicit pictures of his enormous ego. (This was heavily retweeted)
      &lt;/li&gt;

        My moms annoying. She texted this to me: “wat time r u leaving”. Would it kill her to type the fucking word?

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<p>Regarding the negative cases (574. Heather cabled/texted to Sarah, 575. Heather cabled/texted at Sarah), I found examples of the former. Here are some examples of “texted to”:</p>
<ul>
<li>@RajaThalyn ugh i texted…couldn’t resist it</li>
<li>RT @teensinschool: I wish there was a class where you just sat and talked and texted for a period.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found no examples of “texted at.” For these, see my discussion of <em>tweet</em>.</p>
<p>Additional similarities</p>
<p>There are other similarities between <em>text</em>, <em>tweet</em> and the other verbs of instrument of communication brought out by the Twitter data.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use with _back_: Heather texted/cabled Sarah back.</li>
<li>Use with adverbial phrases of frequency. Heather texted/cabled Sarah too much.</li>
<li>Use with adverbial phrases of duration. Heather hasn’t texted/cabled Sarah for two days.</li>
<li>Use with adverbial phrases of enumeration: Heather texted/cabled Sarah fifty times</li>
<li>use with points in time: Heather texted/cabled Sarah at midnight</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional notes</p>
<p>The vast majority of tweets I looked at have a pronominal direct object as message recipient: [someone] texted you/him/her/me/u/yu; A rough estimate is 80% of the tweets in my sample are of this format, and the great majority (95% or so) of these are forms of “me” and “you.” For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>@ohuaintknow i texted uu too hoe</li>
<li>WWHHOOOOAAA!!!! dis chick jus texted me nd said “Yu wanna take me to halloween horror nights?” uhhh no bitch lmao</li>
<li>@KolorfulKisses2 I had texted you to tell ya</li>
<li>@puckzilla19 Well Santana’s mom texted me she is a sleep. Can I help with Rachel?</li>
<li>@ILoveTashae i texted you faggot</li>
<li>damn , like 4 ppl just texted me &amp; asked what am I doing . . O_o</li>
<li>I THINK Taj texted me because I recognized her area code.</li>
<li>My mom just texted me: Hiiiii LOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>So, I would like to suggest that, like <em>tweet</em>, <em>text</em> is a <em>radio</em> verb; that is, one of Levin’s “Verbs of Instrument of Communication.” More analysis is required, here, as for <em>tweet</em>. But if you have any comments, please write me below.</p>
