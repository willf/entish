    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I really enjoyed Google’s Superbowl ad, in which a love story is told as a series of search queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>study abroad paris france</li>
<li>cafes near the louve (<em>sic</em>)</li>
<li>translate tu es très mignon</li>
<li>impress a french girl</li>

<li>jobs in paris</li>
<li>AA120</li>
<li>churches in paris</li>
<li>how to assemble a crib</li>
</ul>
<p>I was curious how Google would do “in real life” on these queries, as well as how Bing (my employer) does. Not surprisingly, Google does well on all these queries. I am pleased to state that Bing does well, too, although I have to admit that the specific results from the translate and “AA120” (a flight search) are not quite as succinctly done (yet!) as Google’s are. But all of the general and “local” queries (even the one with “Louvre” misspelled) are every bit as good as Google’s, and sometimes better presented. “Churches in paris”, I think, is nicer–showing images of churches first before the “local” search.</p>
<p>At this point, I’d claim that Bing really is as good or better than Google for general search–not based on this ad, of course, but from my daily use of both.</p>
<p>I also notice that the link clicked in the video for “how to impress a french girl” is now welcoming people who saw the Google ad.</p>
