    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I was writing some instrumentation code in C# today that looked like this:</p>
<p><code>MeasureOn(&quot;SomeFeature&quot;); ComputeSomeFeature(); MeasureOff(&quot;SomeFeature&quot;); MeasureOn(&quot;AnotherFeature&quot;); ComputeAnotherFeature(); MeasureOff(&quot;AnotherFeature&quot;);</code></p>
<p>If I were using a language with (compile-time) code macros (like Clojure, Scheme or Lisp), I’d prefer to write something like:</p>
<p><code>Measuring(&quot;SomeFeature&quot;){ComputeSomeFeature();} Measuring(&quot;AnotherFeature&quot;){ComputeAnotherFeature();}</code></p>
<p>But C# doesn’t have such a basic and useful thing, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/csharpfaq/archive/2004/03/09/86979.aspx">by design</a> (bad design, I think, but still by design).</p>
<p>But C# does have first-class anonymous functions, so it’s possible to write methods that take one of these as a parameter. This allowed me to write something like:</p>
<p><code>Measuring(&quot;SomeFeature&quot;, () =&gt; { ComputeSomeFeature(); }); Measuring(&quot;AnotherFeature&quot;, () =&gt; { ComputeAnotherFeature(); });</code></p>
<p>This is almost not horrible. It was a little tricky to find out how to declare anonymous functions in C# code. But it runs out that .NET has a special class for anonymous functions which take no values and return no values; .NET calls one of these an <code>Action</code>.</p>
<p>So, my Measuring method looks something like this:</p>
<p>private void Measuring(string feature, Action f) {   MeasureOn(feature);   f();   MeasureOff(feature); }</p>
<p>I did some simple timing on the ‘macro’ vs. the ‘non-macro’ version of these; basically, you pay the cost of an additional function call. I don’t know enough about .NET to know how much continuation state would get passed; this was adequate for my purposes, anyway. Perhaps a more knowledgeable commentator will comment.</p>
<p>(This is a note to my future self; I’m sure to forget the details about getting around the limits of C# not having compile-time macros).</p>
