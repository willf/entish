<p>Well, with the <a href="http://willwhim.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/using-ngram-data-for-segmentation/">Bing Ngram data</a>, we can provide more exact figures which don’t depend on all of the choice and ranking decisions made by a search engine to include or not a page in a result, and (in particular) the estimate of the number of pages on which the term appears.</p>
<p>So, I can say that ‘fucking free’ is the most common ‘fucking <em>adjective</em>‘ pair (though one suspects we’re not talking about free-as-in-speech here); followed by <em>hot, hard, young, hardcore, black, awesome, big, white, old, sexy, good, great, amazing, huge, blonde, naked, asian, nude, sweet, crazy, horny,</em> and <em>hotttttttttt</em>. And the least likely are <em>lap-straked, cortico-hypothalamic, cloven-hooved, cloven-footed, Malayo-Polynesian, most-favored-nation,</em> and <em>neo-Lamarkian.</em></p>
<p>Science marches on.</p>
