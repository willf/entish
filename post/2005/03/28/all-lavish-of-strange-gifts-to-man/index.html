This will be of interest to only those people who are interested in both grammar and Sacred Harp. I may be the only one in this group. However, hope springs eternal …</p>
<p>In Easter Anthem (236), the poetry ends:</p>
<p>Man, all immortal hail,<br>
Hail heaven, all lavish of strange gifts to man,<br>
Thine’s all the glory,<br>
Man’s the boundless bliss.</p>
<p>I’m having trouble parsing this. Maybe you can help…</p>
<p>Question 1. Who is hailing, and who is being hailed?</p>
<p>I think it’s ‘Man’ and ‘Heaven’ hailing God, but it could be we are hailing ‘immortal Man’ (i.e., Jesus, I assume) and ‘heaven.’ (i.e., God, I assume).</p>
<p>Question 2: What does ‘all lavish of strange gifts to man’  mean?</p>
<p>It seems to me that ‘lavish’ has to be a noun, grammatically. If so, it probably means something like ‘lavisher’ or ‘giver’–i.e., ‘heaven, giver of strange gifts to man’; or ‘the lavished’, or ‘blessed’, i.e., ‘hail heaven, O ye who are lavished with strange gifts.’ Any thoughts?</p>
