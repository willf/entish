Mark was off to a ‘black-tie’ party of this own (having found a spiffy tuxedo for $20 dollars–shades of <a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/napoleondynamite/">Napoleon Dynamite</a>–at a thrift store).</p>
<p>We played our usual guys vs. girls games–we had a hoot with <a href="http://www.boardgames.com/catchphrase.html">Catch Phrase</a>, where we learned how differently kids and adults remember and image things: ‘Poison Ivy’ was primarily a movie character to one nephew, and ‘Crankshaft’ only a cartoon to another. This year–for the first time in many years–the guys beat the girls. I guess I should disclose this only happened because I persuaded Kathy Alderman to play on the guys’ team. (We’re pretty sure Kathy is telepathic, at least with respect to word and drawing games).</p>
<p>We got to bed at 2 a.m. I somewhat foolishly got up at 7 a.m. to sing <a href="http://www.mhsc.ca/index.asp?content=http://www.mhsc.ca/encyclopedia/contents/H375.html">Harmonia Sacra</a> down in Goshen, Indiana. This is similar, but not identical, to <a href="http://www.fasola.org">Sacred Harp</a>. A tune I really like is the first one we sang: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/mlmoore_99.geo/Amboy_HS.mid">Amboy</a>, which is not in the <a href="http://www.entish.org/sh/1991.html">Denson book</a>.</p>
<p>Best wishes to all for a happy new year.</p>
