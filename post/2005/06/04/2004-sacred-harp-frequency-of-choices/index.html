<p>Perhaps the most interesting difference between the <a href="http://www.entish.org/sh/2002_denson.html">2002 frequencies</a> is the apparent strong effect of Cold Mountain — 282, I’m Going Home, is was the most chosen tune in 2004. In 2002, it was tied for 54th place–along with Idumea (47b), which moved up to 19th place in 2004.</p>
