It’s among the least beautiful places I’ve ever seen–the homes are non-descript, the businesses are strip-maill ugly. My father still lives there, so I visit it from time to time. One point of artistic light is a funky little studio run by Ed Stross, who has painted a large mural on the side of his building with portraits of Mother Theresa and Princess Diana. So, of course the obvious thing to do is to threaten to <a href="http://www.freep.com/news/locmac/mural18e_20050218.htm">send him to jail</a> for including a bare-breasted Eve.</p>
<p>His studio is kitty-corner from the <a href="http://www.rosevilletheatre.com/">Roseville Theatre</a>, one of the only interesting buidlings in Roseville, where I spent a lot of time as a youth watching double features such as my favorite combonation ever: The Paper Lion and The Yellow Submarine. It now shows indie films and is a band venue. I have no idea where they get an audience for indie films in Roseville.</p>
