<p>The NCSA is <a href="http://vburton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/indexsize.html">somewhat disclaiming</a> the index size study published on the NCSA website, and the study has been revised somewhat. Véronis is keeping up: his latest post, <a href="http://aixtal.blogspot.com/2005/08/yahoo-missing-pages-4.html">Technologies du Langage: Yahoo: Missing pages? (4)</a>, includes the original stronger disclaimer, and discusses why the revised study is still flawed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, this new study is just as biaised as the previous one. It still counts numerous junk documents returned by Google, and doesn’t address other important issues.</p>

<p>I’m a bit surprised that no one else has mentioned the English bias of the NCSA study.</p>
<p>In some ways, the thing that most disturbs me about this flap is that the <a href="http://vburton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">Vernon Burton</a> has had his name taken off the study (including the <a href="http://vburton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/oldstudy.html">old study</a>), leaving his two students ‘on the battlefield,’ as Véronis put it. This morning, <a href="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:oy3pt1tVpb0J:vburton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/searchengineindexstudy.pdf++site:vburton.ncsa.uiuc.edu+A+Comparison+of+the+Size+of+the+Yahoo!+and+Google+Indices&amp;hl=en">Google</a> and <a href="http://216.109.125.130/search/cache?p=A+Comparison+of+the+Size+of+the+Yahoo%21+and+Google+Indices&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;vst=0&amp;vs=vburton.ncsa.uiuc.edu&amp;u=vburton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/searchengineindexstudy.pdf&amp;w=comparison+size+yahoo+google+indices&amp;d=AF8DD72C56&amp;icp=1&amp;.intl=us">Yahoo</a> still have a version of the August 8 version of the study the in their respective caches, showing Burton’s name as a co-author.</p>
