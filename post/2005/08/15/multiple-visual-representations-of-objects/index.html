<blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, the study affirms that there really isn’t a single fundamental visual representation in the brain — the representation used to recognize an object is not the same as the representation used to pick up that object. Because of the different functions of these tasks, this probably doesn’t sound too surprising but, to me, it is surprising! What we consciously see is neurally separate from what our motor system is “seeing” and the break between the two pathways happens quite early in visual processing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Like the mirror neuron work, this provides further evidence in the “seeing is believing/doing” vein. As the author of the news and views summary points out, this work <strong>remind[s] us once more that (ultimately) the brain did not evolve to enable us to think; it evolved to enable us to act.</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This could be the tagline for <a href="http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov/apex/content/about.html">our autonomy architecture</a>. (via <a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/">Mind Hacks</a>).</p>
