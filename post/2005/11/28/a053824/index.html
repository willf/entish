<p>This is a special application of the general result first discovered by Legendre in 1808 that the largest power of a prime p dividing n! is … [formula omitted].</p>

<p>Nice to know I’m on the trailing edge of early 19th century number theory. I now promise myself a rest from Tim Converse and Joyce Park-related postings.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it’s a little difficult to search for 100! on both Yahoo Search and Google–and the Yahoo calculator doesn’t calculate factorial, and Google’s gives an approximation. But searching for “100 factorial is” on Yahoo and Google yields <a href="http://hanuri.jnu.ac.kr/lecture/language/clang/restroom1.html">this page in Korean</a>.</p>
