<p>The first half of the manuscript of Twain’s <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, which was begun in 1876 and published in 1885, was discovered in 1990 ‘in an old steamer trunk stored in the attic of a Los Angeles house.’ It includes a description of a camp meeting that is more expansive than the published version. I thought the readers of this mail list would be interested in the published and manuscript versions of the beginning part of the story, in which a preacher is lining out a hymn. Twain is depicting a time ‘forty to fifty years ago’ (i.e., roughly 1835-1845):</p>
<p>Published version:</p>
<p>The first shed we come to, the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to sing–and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end, some begun to groan, and some begun to shout.</p>
<p>MS version:</p>
<p>The first shed we come to, the preacher was lining-out a hymn. He lined out two lines; everybody sung it–roared it out, they did, in a most rousing way:</p>
<p>“Am I a soldier of the cross, A follower of the Lamb,”–</p>
<p>–then the preacher lined-out the next two:</p>
<p>“And shall I fear to own his cause, Or blush to speak his name?”</p>
<p>–And so on. The people work up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end, some begun to groan, and some begun to shout.</p>
<p>This is from the Random House 1996 “The Adventures of Mark Twain: The Only Comprehensive Edition.” The dating comes from editors’ notes. [Note sent to the Fasola discussion list.]</p>
