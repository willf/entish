I get to sing <a href="http://hem.passagen.se/obrecht/backpages/chords/01_bobdylan/man_of_constant_sorrow.htm">I am a man of constant sorrow</a> as Jeremiah, the weeping prophet. I think I’m supposed to sing it as a parody of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soggy_Bottom_Boys">The Soggy Bottom Boys</a>, who are a ficticious old-time band that (in the movie) record a surprise hit and that (in what is sometimes called ‘real’ life) record a surprise hit, winning both a CMA award and a Grammy. Their “I am a man of constant sorrow” is a clever parody of a Stanley Brothers hit. Ralph Stanley sings none of the four versions on the soundtrack, although he does sing <a href="http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/obrotherwhereartthou/odeath.htm">O Death</a>, which is about the hauntinest song imaginable. Bob Dylan did <a href="http://bobdylan.com/songs/sorrow.html">Sorrow</a>. So did <a href="http://skeewiff.com/free.html">Skeewiff</a>. I’m not sure what  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&amp;chapter=15&amp;verse=17&amp;end_verse=17&amp;version=9&amp;context=context">Jeremiah would think</a>.</p>
<p>But, you know, why should the devil get all the good mash-ups?</p>
