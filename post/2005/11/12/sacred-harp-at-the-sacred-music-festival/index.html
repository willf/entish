Martha Beverley and Sam Sommers lead a Sacred Harp workshop this morning; I love listening to Sam describe how to remember the shapes: ‘FA points fa-r fa-r away; LA is square like the Law (and starts with L, which is square); SO is round like the Sol, the sun; and MI is a diamond–diamonds are relatively rare, as are MIs, so diamonds are for me.’ It looks like we may have picked up a couple of new singers today (though time will tell).</p>
<p>One new singer we have is <a href="http://photo.dev.advance.net/cgi-bin/slide-show.cgi/mlive/admin/slide_show_admin.ata?index=4&amp;g_id=1387">Mary Powers</a>, who is the coolest Drain Commissioner (well, ex-Drain Commissioner) you’ll ever meet. (Hey, <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/001266.html">Lemondor</a>, I bet you never get to chill with drain commissioners!)</p>
<p>Singing today allowed us to score free tickets to hear <a href="http://earlymusichicago.org/ensembles_mixed.htm">Chicago Syntagma Musicum</a> presenting “A Spanish Medieval Pilgrimage.”</p>
