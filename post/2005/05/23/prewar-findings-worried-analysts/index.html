<p>More evidence that Bush et al. cooked the evidence for WMD in Iraq:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Bush said in his Jan. 28, 2003, State of the Union address that Hussein was working to obtain “significant quantities” of uranium from Africa, a conclusion the president attributed to British intelligence and made a key part of his assertion that Iraq had an active nuclear weapons program.More than a year later, the White House retracted the statement after its veracity was questioned. But the Senate report makes it clear that even in January 2003, just before the president’s speech, analysts at the CIA’s Weapons Intelligence, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Center were still investigating the reliability of the uranium information.
