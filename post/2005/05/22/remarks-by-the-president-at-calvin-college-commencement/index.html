<blockquote>
<p>As the Class of 2005 goes out into the world, I ask you to embrace this tradition of service and help set an example for all Americans. As Americans we share an agenda that calls us to action — a great responsibility to serve and love others, a responsibility that goes back to the greatest commandment. This isn’t a Democratic idea. This isn’t a Republican idea. This is an American idea. (Applause.) It has sustained our nation’s liberty for more than 200 years. The Founders knew that too much government leads to oppression, but that too little government can leave us helpless and alone.
Which is not to say that I don’t also agree with the <a href="http://www.vaughnthompson.com/ichthus/archives/2005/05/calvin_college.php">Open Letter to the President.</a></p>
