<p><a href="http://m-w.com">Merriam-Webster Online</a> gives this definition of “dub” (among others, of course):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to trim or remove the comb and wattles of. (<a href="http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=30719">Here’s</a> a Mudcat cafe discussion of various lyrics for “In the Jailhouse Now”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think I’ll need to talk about wattle-trimming, but I think I might start saying, “don’t flub your dub.”</p>
