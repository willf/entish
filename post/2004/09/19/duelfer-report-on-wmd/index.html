Although it states that Iraq clearly intended to produce WMD at some point, no significant evidence of WMDs have been found. This is very significant because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The US went to war in Iraq citing the immediate danger of Iraq’s WMD program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UN inspection program in Iraq argued that WMDs were very unlikely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UN inspection program was actively monitoring possible WMD sites in Iraq.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, more than 1000 US solders have died in Iraq, to say nothing of thousands of Iraqi citizens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Either Bush was lying about the justification for going to war, or he was mislead by his subordinates, or he and his subordinates were incompetent. In any case, it is clear that Bush is not fit to continue to be the president of the US. Charles Hanley of the Associated Press quotes Hans Blix: “There was a very consistent creation of a virtual reality” by the US officials, “and eventually it collided with our old-fashioned, ordinary reality.”</p>
