<p>I could be wrong, but I think this debate shows that the right’s use of “liberal” as a scare word is dying. Bush, at least, didn’t seem to make any headway with it. Kerry as to the left of Ted Kennedy–hah! I don’t think anyone will buy that who’s not already a dittohead.</p>
<p>OK–I’ll predict that Kerry will beat Bush in the popular vote with approximately the same margin as Gore beat Bush in 2000. Whether he’ll win the electoral college vote remains to be seen.</p>
