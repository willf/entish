<p>I just received this book as a Christmas present. My first encounter, I think, with the New Yorker cartoons was in college, where they were scotch-taped on the doors of the offices of professors and grad assistants in Wells Hall, which housed the mathematics and linguistics departments.</p>
<p>The obsessive in me enjoys owning all 68,647 cartoons from the first 80 years of the New Yorker (and worries a bit about falling behind). The nostalgic enjoys remembering great cartoons. I also read a few together with my daughter Jane: for example, two large crackled-edge holes on a frozen lake titled, “Sumos on Ice!” She surprised me by ‘getting’ the joke.</p>
<p>OK, if I read one cartoon every ten seconds …</p>
