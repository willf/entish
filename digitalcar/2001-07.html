<p>Ah, here's <a href="http://www.nj.com/newsflash/index.ssf?/cgi-free/getstory_ssf.cgi?a0711_BC_CellPhoneUse&&news&newsflash-washington">another news article about the NHSTA cell phone use study</a>: The "20 to 30%" is accidents caused by <i>some</i> sort of driver distraction. The <a href="http://www.thedigitalcar.com/2001-05.html#9">UNC study we linked to earlier</a> claimed a maximum rate of 13% for all distractions (and cell phones were a miniscule part of this -- but the study was somewhat old).

<p><b>Ahah!</b> After some digging, I found <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/ncsa/ResearchNotes/809-293.pdf">the NHTSA report</a> (PDF format). Their summary:<blockquote>
Nationally, overall hand-held cell phone use by
drivers of passenger vehicles (Table 1) was estimated at
3 percent. This means that at <b>any given time during
daylight hours, about 3 percent of drivers of
passenger cars, vans, SUVs, and pickups are
actively using a cell phone</b>. Assuming that the 200
million registered passenger vehicles are driven on
public roads for an average of one hour during daylight
hours, there are an average of about 16.7 million
passenger vehicles on the roads during any given
daylight hour; in turn, this translates into approximately
one-half million drivers using cell phones at any given
time. The 2000 Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Survey
also estimated that 73 percent of drivers who said they
usually have a wireless phone in their vehicle with them
use a hand-held cell phone and an additional 22 percent
use “hands-free” equipment. Extrapolating this result to
the NOPUS hand-held cell phone observations results
in an additional 0.9 percent of drivers using “hands-free”
cell phones for a total of 3.9 percent (or more than
600,000) of drivers actively using cell phones at any one
time.
</blockquote>

<p>And their 20-30% quote:<blockquote>Additionally, the
NASS General Estimates System estimated that
various forms of driver distraction contributed to
between 25 and 30 percent of injury and property damage-
only crashes.

<p>How many drivers are using their cell phones right now? <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/07/23/cell.drivers/index.html" title="thanks, Michael!">Half a million</a>.

<p>The CNN article also claims:<blockquote>[O]ther NHTSA data suggests cell phones contribute to approximately 20 percent to 30 percent of all crashes. </blockquote> What study is this from?

<p>Yet another USB Warburg study: <a href="http://news.excite.com/news/pr/010723/ny-ubs-warburg-study">Traffic information systems to be $7 billion industry</a>, dominated by Westwood One and Mobility Technologies:<blockquote>UBS Warburg researchers said that the telematics market "has developed a bit more slowly than we had forecast" in last year's industry spanning report, "Worldwide Telematics Market: Eyes on the Road, Hands on the Wheel." But, the firm noted, it could accelerate with the emergence of a "killer app" such as real time personalized traffic data. </blockquote>

<p>IBM is working on an <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991039">artificial passenger</a>:<blockquote>The heart of the system is a conversation planner that holds a profile of you, including details of your interests and profession. When activated, the [artificial passenger] uses the profile to cook up provocative questions such as, "Who was the first person you dated?" via a speech generator and the in-car speakers. 

Your answer is picked up by a microphone and broken down into separate words by speech-recognition software. A camera built into the dashboard also tracks your lip movements to improve the accuracy of the speech recognition. A voice analyser then looks for signs of tiredness by checking to see if the answer matches your profile. Slow responses and a lack of intonation are read as signs of fatigue.

<p><a href="http://www.vny.com/cf/News/upidetail.cfm?QID=202409">It's the conversation, stupid</a>. University of Kansas professor claims what's distracting about cell phone use isn't the 'handheld' part, but the 'conversational' part:<blockquote>
 "Most of us, when we are driving and the traffic is really heavy, just
ignore the radio. We can selectively turn that off," he said. Similarly,
in-car conversations differ because both parties are aware of traffic
conditions and can discontinue their conversation if things get too
complicated.
</blockquote>
But what if the <a href="http://www.inetmi.com/ci/whyci/index.html">interface</a> were aware of traffic conditions, too?

uses speaker-independent voice recognition, enabling any driver to use simple
English commands to place or answer calls on their cell phones without having
to look at or touch the phone.  The system's patented Universal Docking
Station and phone-specific Pocket Adapters accommodate cell phones of various
makes and models. </blockquote>

Some key features:<blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Voice Recognition</b> - enhanced voice control interface. This system allows easy verbal input of commonly used commands to simplify operation and enhance driver safety.<b>Traffic Information</b> - real-time traffic using the CUE Radio Network System (optional) which can re-route the user around traffic situations. Receive traffic information, weather and news information using icons through the CUE receiver and service. <b>Video Playback</b> - integrate into the vehicle's audio/video system to function as a DVD video playback and CD audio source. <b>PC Card Slot</b> - allows for future upgrades as they become available.</font> </blockquote>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/Pioneer/CDA/CarProducts/CarProductDetails/0,1429,2248,00.html">Product page</a>, it looks like the price is $2,400, without a display.

<p>Needs and guidelines of the automotive industry (in introducing telematics products and services):

<ul>
<li>Human engineering (to avoid future legal action)
<li>No-harm to the image
<li>No-harm to the system
<li>There must be a valid business case
<li>Whose market place is the terminal inside the vehicle?
<ul><li>OEM will not allow anyone to damage the car brand with
bad services!
<li>Up-selling business for the OEM must not be deteriorated<br>
</ul>
<li>Commitment: Who will take care of the end to end functionality and
fulfillment of service? (Terminal performance is not enough)

<p>A good use for telematics, perhaps: <a href="http://www.eyeforauto.com/subpages.asp?news=17295">remote diagnostics</a>. This article, though, doesn't mention concerns about control and privacy that might arise for vehicle owners. 

<p>GM will use SpeechWorks' text-to-speech software. <a href="http://www.me-mag.com/bn.cfm?rank_cho=552">Mobile Electronics article</a>. Interesting internal quote:<blockquote>GM enforces a rigid rule among product developers that if the dashboard has any screen visible to the driver, the screen must be disabled whenever the car is not in park or neutral. The world's largest automaker is betting that voice-activated technology, including voice-based e-mail and stock updates, will eventually replace visual data for use in the automobile. 

Despite GM's rule, industry executives still debate whether onboard communications should be controlled primarily by voice, touch or modified sight - including heads-up displays that flash e-mail or weather updates on the windshield in a see-through manner.

"As the number of in-car devices and off-board services available to drivers multiply, safe driving requires a system that can carry on a natural dialogue with a driver and that knows about what is going on in a car, including potential distractions. Even voice commands are distracting if you struggle to remember what the commands are."</blockquote>
