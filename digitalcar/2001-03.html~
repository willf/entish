Some of the analyses are suspect (but, then again, since it's from an investment bank, you already knew that), but it seems pretty good on the raw facts of telematics: the players, what the offerings are, glossary of terms. 
<p>They also think conversational interfaces will be very important: 

<blockquote>Given the performance of the VUIs [voice-based user interfaces] we have tested so far, great strides need to be made in
this area before a totally hands-free, user-friendly, voice-operated TCU [telematics control unit] becomes a viable
daily tool for the driver....We view this issue as perhaps the greatest determinant of adoption
and penetration rates for the Telematics industry.</blockquote>
