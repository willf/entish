<h1><a href="driver_distraction.html#%_toc_%_sec_A">A&nbsp;&nbsp;Are &#8220;hands-free&#8221; cell phones &#8220;risk-free&#8221;?</a></h1><p>

No.<p>

Because legislation has been proposed in a number of countries and
U.S. localities that hands-on cell phones be banned, it is easy to
reach the concluding that hands-free cell phones are less risky than
hands-on cell phones. <p>

But a number of studies have strongly indicated that the most
distracting part of a cell phone call is not dialing the call, but the
cognitive load of talking on the phone.<p>

Typically, dialing a cell phone number takes about ten seconds. The
typical cell phone call is two minutes&#8211;that is, the conversation
lasts, on average, twelve times as long as the dialing. At least one
&#8220;anchor task&#8221; study indicates that dialing the cell phone is roughly
as distracting as radio dialing. <p>

Talking on the phone is very distracting for at least three
reasons. First, conversation requires a lot of cognition. My favorite
quotation on this subject is<p>

<blockquote>
Anyone of driving age has made numerous phone calls, using land
lines, during their lifetimes. How do we respond to someone who is
standing in front of us trying to capture our attention while we are
on the phone? Often we wave them away, or interrupt our conversation
on the phone to address the other person. Even after years of
talking on the land line phone, our ability to concentrate on more
than one activity doesn’t seem to improve. (Frances Bents, from the
<a href="http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/driver-distraction/AskTheExperts.htm">Ask
the Experts forum</a> described above).
</blockquote><p>

Secondly, because the person we are talking to cannot see the other
potential distractions, and so is not aware when he or she should be
quiet or wait for an answer. <p>

Finally, cell phone use while driving is dangerous because people
overrate their ability to judge the consequences of small
probability/high cost risks. The chance of an accident while driving
and talking on a cell phone may be small, although it must be said
that what society might consider &#8220;small&#8221; and what the actual number
of accidents attributable to cell-phone use is not currently
known. But even if it is small&#8211;again, this is not clear&#8211;people
probably underestimate the risks involved.<p>
