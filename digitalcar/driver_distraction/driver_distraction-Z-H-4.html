There are a variety of things that can be done to minimize driver
distraction. <em>Social</em> interventions, such as legislation and
driver education are important, although it is generally agreed that
the effectiveness of these are limited. For example, a legislative ban
on cell phone use in moving vehicles may be a good idea, but cell
phone use is just one of many possible distractors, and it is unclear
how effectively such a law could be enforced, and how large a decrease
in distraction-related accidents would result. <em>Economic
sanctions</em> which naturally occur as a result of increasing insurance
rates (say, for example, higher rates for people who use cell phones
while driving, or are involved in accidents while using a cell phone)
may also have an effect, although it is likely that such sanctions
will take a while to put into place, and is clearly a reactive
strategy.<p>

<em>Technological and design</em> solutions to minimize driver
distraction is important. Vehicles and in-vehicle devices must be
designed with safety in mind, and working with ergonomicists and
others who study human attention is crucial. <p>

For example, The U.S. Department of Transportation sponsored
<a href="http://www.its.dot.gov/cyberdocs/edldocs/7424/index.html">Human
Factors Design Guidelines</a> for &#8220;Advanced Traveler Information
Systems&#8221; (ATIS). <p>

There is some research indicating that speech-based interaction for
controlling in-vehicle devices&#8211;that is, being able to talk with your
car about the things you want it to do&#8211;may help minimize distraction,
perhaps because it allows the driver to engage in multiple tasks
simultaneously (i.e., simple talking/listening while scanning the
road). Also, it may be the case that older and younger drivers have
similar response characteristics for speech-based systems. It&#8217;s a very
complicated issue however, with lots of confounding variables. For
example, it is a well-known ergonomic principle that listening to
long speech segments requires a high cognitive load (because of
short-term memory rehearsal requirements), and thus the ability to
multi-task may decrease because thinking what&#8217;s being said interferes
with thinking about driving.<p>

Improving the sensing and reactive abilities of vehicles may also help
to minimize distractions, or at least notice when a driver is becoming
distracted or drowsy. For example, it has been suggested that heart
rate monitors in seat belts may be useful, because certain heart
characteristics are correlated with cognitive workload. As another
example, navigation systems might be augmented with ratings on how
dangerous intersections are. The navigation system might respond
differently at dangerous intersections than at less dangerous ones or
on straight portions, just as a passenger giving directions tends to
not give directions at busy intersections.<p>

Currently, most accident-causing distractions occur <em>outside</em> the
vehicle, so it must be recognized that any technological solutions
<em>inside</em> the vehicle will have a minimal effect on overall
distraction-related accidents. Still, it is hard to argue that the
increasing complexity of in-vehicle tasks will not play an
increasingly large role in increasing driver distraction.<p>
