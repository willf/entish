<h1><br><br>Driver Distraction</h1>

<p>

When my wife was taking driver education classes as a teenager, she
was given a final exam with the following fill-in-the-blank question: <p>

Driving is a ____ time job.<p>

It&#8217;s one of our family jokes to think of answers other than &#8220;full.&#8221;
Of course, when my wife and I were teenagers, we didn&#8217;t have to drive
<em>and</em> talk on a cell phone, get the kids to stop fighting in the
back seat, play a CD, or interact with an on-board navigation
system. Nor were the streets filled with <em>other</em> drivers doing
the same thing (except for the fighting kids, of course). So, I guess
the answer today is &#8220;Driving is a more-than-a-full-time job.&#8221;<p>

It seems unlikely that cars are going to any <em>less</em> complicated
in the near future. In order to understand how technology contributes
to problems of driver distraction&#8211;as well as possible technological
solutions to driver distraction&#8211;we need a good understanding of how
people act and react to the increasingly complicated driving environment.<p>
