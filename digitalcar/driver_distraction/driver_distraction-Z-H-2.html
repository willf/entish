<h1><a href="driver_distraction.html#%_toc_%_sec_2">2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Effects of Driver Distraction</a></h1><p>

Consider the typical Hollywood driver distraction disaster scenario. The driver
is tooling down the road, listening to a cassette tape, or eating a
sandwich. The driver accidentally drops the tape or sandwich or
whatever, and reaches down to get it and completely ignores what is
happening on the road. When the driver looks up again: bang! A big
rig, or train appears, and the driver dies.<p>

There is this obvious danger of switching tasks so completely that the
main driving task is ignored. Remembering that a car going 70 miles
per hour travels over 100 feet in a second, we can see that
it doesn&#8217;t take long for a disaster to occur. Yet, because people are
very good at task-switching, there are some other results that are not
necessarily obvious when there are distractions, including slower
reaction time, decreased ability to see hazards, and a &#8220;shrinking
operating envelope.&#8221;<p>

Reaction time is the amount of time it takes us to move from perceiving
to action. Usually, the faster we respond, the better, but when we
distracted, the amount of time per task increases. This is a clear
result of our attention being split between tasks, as well as the
increased cost of switching between tasks. Because vehicles can be
moving very quickly, even sub-second increases in reaction time can be
dangerous. Because our attention is being split, it is also more
likely that we will perceive fewer potential hazards while
driving. The Hollywood scenario is the extreme of this, but, again,
even missing one potential hazard in our visual field, for example,
can be very dangerous. <p>

The &#8220;operating envelope&#8221; is the space in which you feel safe to
act. For example, while making a left hand turn, your brain makes very
complicated calculations about how quickly oncoming traffic is
arriving, and hence, how much space and time you have to act. When
drivers are distracted, they tend to think they can act in a smaller
amount of space and time then is actually safe, thus increasing the
risk of an accident. <p>
