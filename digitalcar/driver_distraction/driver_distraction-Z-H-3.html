<h1><a href="driver_distraction.html#%_toc_%_sec_3">3&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring Driver Distractions</a></h1><p>

Studies of driver distraction use a number of measurements as direct
or indirect measures. These include tracking eye movements, number of
times a driver goes outside of the driving lanes (&#8220;lane exceeds&#8221;),
the time to complete a task (such as turning on the radio, or dialing
a cell phone number). Because it is expensive (and potentially
dangerous) to run studies while driving, researchers are looking for
other means to create valid and reliable measurements, such as using
simulations. Ford Research, for example, is completing work on their
<a href="http://www.media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=7010">VIRTTEX</a> simulator.<p>

Because it is difficult to specify absolute measurements of &#8220;safe&#8221;
amounts of driver distractions, researchers also use certain &#8220;anchor
tasks&#8221; as baselines. If a new task&#8211;for example, dialing a cell
phone&#8211;is no more distracting than the anchor task, then there is some
confidence that the new task is safe enough. Perhaps ironically, given
the original controversy, turning on a radio is often used as an
anchor task.<p>

Still, measuring driver workload is a difficult task. &#8220;Turning on the
radio&#8221; using one manufacturer&#8217;s radio is markedly different from
another&#8217;s, for example. Some efforts at standardizing tasks are under weigh.<p>
