<h1><a href="driver_distraction.html#%_toc_%_sec_1">1&nbsp;&nbsp;A Simple Model of Human Attention Processing</a></h1><p>

Imagine you are driving down the road, and, suddenly, a child darts
out in front of your car. A simple model of how people act 
describes three stages: first, you <em>perceive</em> the child running,
then you <em>think about</em> what to do&#8211;perhaps decide to swerve&#8211;and
then you <em>act</em>, swerving the car out of the way. Each of these
stages require a certain amount of your attention; each
stage&#8211;perception, cognition, action&#8211;takes an increasing amount of
your attention. <p>

Turning your attention from one thing to another is called
&#8220;task-switching.&#8221; The more tasks a person has to undertake at the
same time, the more difficult it is for a person to achieve the tasks,
not only because there are more tasks to do, but also because
task-switching takes a certain amount of attention.<p>

In some cases, people can do more than one thing at the same time. For
example, they can keep a reasonably steady speed by applying pressure
to the accelerator while scanning for oncoming traffic. This can only
occur if different resources (your foot, your vision) are available
for the tasks. It&#8217;s much more complicated than this, of course,
because tasks are often comprised of other tasks, and if any subtask
needs to share a resource, then task-switching has to
occur. Further, some tasks are so well learned that very little
cognition is required. For example, shifting from one gear to another
becomes such a routine act that we find it difficult to describe.<p>

The main task of driving a car is to arrive at a location
safely. Other tasks, such as eating a pizza, listening to our e-mail,
turning off the radio, or talking to the kids in the back seat, are
potential distractions from this. In the simple model of
human attention processing we have given, we want to minimize the
number of tasks and task switches that occur. Of course, people
<em>will</em> do other things than drive, but it&#8217;s worth noting that
when car radios were first being installed in automobiles, there was a
big debate&#8211;reminiscent of today&#8217;s debates about cell phone use&#8211;as to
whether they ought to be banned as a dangerous distraction.<p>
