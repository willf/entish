href="http://www.voicexmlreview.org/features/Jan2001_what_is_voicexml.html">What
is VoiceXML?</a> <blockquote>
VoiceXML is a language for creating voice-user interfaces,
particularly for the telephone. It uses speech recognition and
touchtone (DTMF keypad) for input, and pre-recorded audio and
text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) for output.  
</blockquote>
In <a
href="http://www.voicexmlreview.org/">VoiceXML Review</a> magazine,
produced by the <a href="http://www.voicexml.org/">VoiceXML
Forum</a>.

<p>This is an especially important quote from the same article:
<blockquote>
Beyond the scope of the language are application logic, state
management, dialog generation and sequencing, database operations, and
interfaces to legacy systems (e.g., "screen scraping"). These are
handled by traditional Web application programming techniques. 
</blockquote>

(The crucial thing to notice is the limitations, but I find the idea
of "traditional Web application programming techniques" to be
amusing. "Yessir, you just do dialog generation and sequencing the
same way your father did, your grandfather before him!")

Inteview</a> with Saul Rubin (of UBS Warburg) on telematics.
Some good quotes:
<blockquote>The companies that will likely take centre stage in
telematics will be those funded by, or have close alliances with,
large auto OEMs. Hence, the likes of OnStar and Wingcast are here to
stay. In europe also, the main telematics players have the backing of
the auto groups and/or wireless companies - e.g. Wireless Car
(Volvo/Ericcson/Telia), Teguron (DaimlerChrysler/Deutsche Telekom),
Wappi! (Peugeot/Vivendi) </blockquote>
and
<blockquote>At the end of the day, the value in telematics is the
content - it is those that provide the best content or are involved in
its delivery or the technology behind it that will
benefit. </blockquote>
and
<blockquote>Telematics services do not necessarily require fancy interfaces - much can be done through voice, and indeed may have to be done through voice in the future. </blockquote>
