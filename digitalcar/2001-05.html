<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/05/24/cell.phone/index.html" title="Thanks, Michael">British Medical Association report</a>: cell phone use while driving is dangerous. This is part of their study <a href="http://www.bma.org.uk/public/science.nsf/sciencedocsvw/ReportMobilePhones">Mobile phones and health: An interim report</a>. The section on <a href="http://www.bma.org.uk/public/science.nsf/ff15359a3b779a2d802566a20038bf31/e6f4f1906a686c7a80256a540044de54?OpenDocument">car and road safety</a> claims:<blockquote>There is strong experimental evidence that those engaging in mobile phone conversation have an impaired ability to react to potentially hazardous situations.... Epidemiological studies have also indicated an association between phone conversation whilst driving and an increase in the risk of involvement in an accident, although causality cannot be attributed.... This finding appears to be unaffected by whether a hands-free kit (HFK) is used or not. For this reason, the Stewart Group concluded that the effect is most likely to be due to the distracting nature of the conversation, and drivers should be dissuaded from using either hand-held or hands-free phones while on the move.</blockquote>

<p>The "Stewart Group" is the British "<a href="http://www.iegmp.org.uk/IEGMPtxt.htm">Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones</a>" that also reported on health issues related to cell phone use. Their focus was mainly on whether RF radiation was a health threat, but in their "<a href="http://www.iegmp.org.uk/IEGMP-5.pdf" title="PDF file">Scientific Evidence</a>" chapter they discuss studies on the relationship between cell phone use and accidents.

<blockquote>"Can you imagine my father trying to use this radio?" a passenger mused as I tried to wend through a maze of on-screen menus without plowing into approaching traffic...<br><br>
The ... V.I.S. requires higher education...<br><br>
If you find Windows 98 frustrating at the office, do you want to operate a scaled-down version at 70 m.p.h. on a rain-slicked highway? The screen in my Q45 test car was as cranky as my office PC...<br><br>
In an attempt to help, Infiniti lets you talk to the system, and over time, with patience and intensive study, you and the Q may manage to communicate. But I was reduced to pleading, "Help, radio," or "Help, navigation," to which the car responded by speaking a list of possible commands. Given the matter of keeping the car out of the ditch, I didn't take notes.

<li>Better <i>human-centered</i> telematics technology,
<li>Better <i>sensing and warning systems</i> in automobiles,
<li>Adequate <i>safety testing</i> of telematic devices,

<p>New <a href="http://www.eyeforauto.com/Subpages.asp?news=15464">driver distraction study</a> from University of North Carolina. Claims: 8-13% (about 284,000) of all serious accidents in the U.S. are caused by driver distraction. Of these,<blockquote>The study found that drivers were most often distracted by something outside their vehicle (29.4 percent) followed by adjusting a radio or CD player (11.4 percent). Other specific distractions included talking with other occupants (10.9 percent), adjusting vehicle or climate controls (2.8 percent), eating or drinking (1.7 percent), cell-phone use (1.5 percent) and smoking (0.9 percent).</blockquote>

<p>So, roughly 30,000 serious accidents a year are caused by people fiddling with the audio system. Suddenly, this doesn't seem like a particularly safe thing to do, despite some <a href="http://www.thedigitalcar.com/driver_distraction/driver_distraction-Z-H-3.html#%_sec_3">claims to the contrary</a>.

<p>I received a question about <a href="#2">the note</a> about recurrence statistics:<blockquote>

About the accident question. I don't know probability math and this may be out of my league, but isn't each trip mutually exclusive and therefore the probability of an accident remains the same always.  </blockquote>

<p>I replied:<blockquote>Thanks for the comments. I'm glad someone's reading them!

<p>You are right that each trip is mutually exclusive. But the question is somewhat different. Imagine you have a coin--how many flips will it take before you get a heads? Of course, it's always a possibility that you'll get a tails every time indefinitely, but the probability of that happening gets vanishingly small (If I got 100 tails in a row, I suspect the coin was unfair, not just say "that happens sometimes"). 

<p>So the question is, given a certain probability, how many flips will it take? It turns out that at a 95% confidence level, it's about 6 flips (in other words, about 1/20th of the time you'll get all tails; 19/20th of the time you'll get *at least* one heads).</blockquote>

<p>A recurring probability question: Assuming that something occurs with probability <i>P</i> (independent at each trial--like a coin toss), and it's an event that you will repeat many times, how many times does the event need to occur (<i>N</i> trials) in order to achieve probability <i>R</i> of occurring at least once?
