<tr><td><b>What is The Digital Car Journal?</b><br>
The Digital Car Journal is a weblog about the use of computers in cars, especially relating to telematics and conversational interfaces.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>What is a weblog?</b><br>
A weblog is a journal or diary of someone's interaction with the Web. Although personal in nature--it is, after all, some person's interaction--it can also be topical, as, of course, the Digital Car Journal is. For a succinct history, see Rebecca Blood's <a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html">Weblogs: A History and Perspective</a>. </td></tr>

<tr><td><b>Who is Will Fitzgerald?</b><br>
Dr. Will Fitzgerald is the chief technology officer of <a href="http://www.inetmi.com">I/NET, Inc.</a> He has a Ph.D. in computer science from Northwestern University. His research and subsequent work has been on building "<a href="http://www.inetmi.com/ci/ci-description.html">conversational interfaces</a>," or systems to allow people to interact with machines via normal language dialog. He's married, has two children, and corrects people's grammar as a hobby. You can contact him at <a href="mailto:fitzgerald@inetmi.com">fitzgerald@inetmi.com</a>.

<tr><td><b>What is telematics?</b><br>
Telematics, very broadly defined, is the use of the wireless internet in vehicles. Telematics applications include navigational aids, safety and emergency services, information and entertainment services and tracking/logistics.
