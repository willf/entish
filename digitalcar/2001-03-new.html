<p>I'm back from the <a href="http://www.sae.org">SAE</a> conference, where I attended a great morning panel on telematics and driver distraction. I'll be writing something up about this very soon.

<p>The <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~cvpumbs/">Center forVenture Capital and Private Equity Finance</a> at the University of Michigan is hosting a event called <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~cvpumbs/programs/telemat.html">Telematics: The Convergence of Information Technology, the Automotive Industry and the Venture Capital Market 
</a> April 18-19, 2001.

<p>General article on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010228/aponline161303_000.htm">telematics</a> from the Associated Press.

<blockquote>Nearly half believe telematics will reach 25-percent penetration in
the Americas market in 3-8 years, according to the survey.</blockquote>

It's not transparent from this press release, but the CERA architecture can play a role in recognizing events on a car bus, too.

<p><a href="http://www.mitechnews.com/show_article.asp?category=60&id=625">SAE Congress Preview</a>. The Digital Car Journal will be there!
<blockquote>The theme of this year show will be succeeding in the alliance game, [SAE spokesman Mark Burd] said. The realities of a rapidly maturing auto industry, fueled by the rush to e-everything, is companies have to form partnerships and alliances to remain competitive, not just in North America, but across the world, he said.

Burd also let slip that two big announcements will be made during the show: Microsoft is scheduled to make one; Covisint another. He wouldn’t provide any hints of what’s to come.

<blockquote>Driving is difficult enough for older people, but when you throw in a heavy dose of telematics, the combination could be dangerous, contends the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute in a study released this week. The age factor makes it doubly important auto makers include older drivers in safety and usability evaluations of future telematics devices. The study results also may further fuel the driver distraction issue triggered by the use of cell phones in moving vehicles.</blockquote>


<p>The <a href="http://www.magicservicesforum.org/">MAGIC Services Initiative</a>: 
<blockquote>The MAGIC Services™ Initiative is a cooperative effort to develop a standard method for remote delivery of core geographic functionality to location-aware applications on mobile devices. Target applications include personal navigation, telematics, and location-based services. The scope of MAGIC Services is a small set of core services deliverable to application service providers (ASPs). These ASPs incorporate the MAGIC Services in mobile applications that they offer to end users or other ASPs. </blockquote>
