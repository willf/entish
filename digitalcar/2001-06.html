<p>We're breaking radio silence here to note that New York State has become the first state to ban the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. <a href="http://news.excite.com/printstory/news/ap/010628/13/news-cell-phone-ban">AP's report</a>. <a href="http://news.excite.com/printstory/news/r/010628/14/life-cellphones">Reuters report</a>. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/06/28/cellphones/index.html">CNN report</a>. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,44816,00.html">Wired News</a> (look for quotes from me in this).

equipped 2001 SUV out onto some nearby country roads, navigating swiftly and
confidently with the optional OnStar Global Positioning System.  When he got
into an accident, he decided to run for it.  But the guidance system had
already notified OnStar headquarters of the accident, specifying where it
had happened and giving a complete description of his vehicle to the
California Highway Patrol.</blockquote>

<p>I was asked: <blockquote>On the radio this morning, I heard that a third of emergency calls are made from cell phones nowadays, and that the government is about to mandate that cell systems have better ways of tracking people.

The system envisioned is one which will facilitate coordination of partners across agency and jurisdictional boundaries to pool resources relating to system performance and dissemination of this information to travelers through a variety of media including a modified telephone service or a newly established 511 service.  The purpose of this model deployment is to showcase new and emerging technologies that enable information to be gathered from many sources with ease and to be disseminated to travelers through voice communication.</blockquote>
