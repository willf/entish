              First, there was the Ur-Sticky:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What's brown and sticky? <em>A stick</em>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Then, Sharon Fenick's riff:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What's green and leaky? <em>A leek.</em>
              </li>
            </ul>
