  <h3>Fitzgerald Family Christmas Newsletter 2003 and 2004</h3>

  <p>Greetings!</p>

  <p><a href= "FitzgeraldChristmas2004_files/image001.jpg"><img

  joke about a baseball game: What inning is it? The eighth.  Who's
  ahead? They're tied, 0-0. Oh, I guess I didn't miss anything then. A
  lot has happened to us over the past two years, but the end of 2004
  finds us (more or less) where we were at the end of 2002, in our
  home in Kalamazoo, Michigan. (By the way, if click on the pictures,
  you'll get a bigger version.)</p>

  <p>Will had some interesting job possibilities in California and
  the West in 2003. When Bess's father Jerry passed away in April,
  we decided to explore these--seriously enough that Will resigned
  from his teaching position at Kalamazoo College. The
  possibilities didn't pan out, but a good job offer came from the
  Canadian National Research Council in Fredericton, New Brunswick.
  Will moved to Canada at the beginning of 2004; Bess and the kids
  stayed behind as Bess readied the house for sale. Will loved the
  job, but it looked difficult to get permission for Bess to work,
  selling and buying a house was going to be more expensive that
  we'd thought, etc., etc., and we decided not to move to Canada.
  Providentially, another opportunity arose: a former office mate
  of Will's from Northwestern was looking for someone to hack on
  robot software at NASA's Ames Research Center, and Will had been
  recently doing very closely related work. Furthermore, Will's
  been able to work remotely, so our family has been able to remain
  in Kalamazoo (Will travels to California once a month or so; you
  can see the project site at <a href=
  "http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov/apex/">http://human-factors.arc.nasa.gov/apex/</a>).</p>

  of all this, Mark was finishing high school. Mark is now a
  freshman at Michigan State University, where he is on track to
  major in business, after deciding against a career in
  architecture. He is learning a lot both in class and out of
  class, and we're glad that he's not too far away--New Brunswick
  would have been some1200 miles away! You can tell that he's the
  coolest of us four. Jane also started a new school this year--her
  sixth grade class was moved to the Maple Street School for the
  Arts. This is just down the street from our home. She loves to
  read, loves her dog Benji, and was the assistant stage manager
  this fall for the Kalamazoo Civic Youth Theatre production of
  Raggedy Anne and Andy. With Mark in college, Bess is working as a
  laboratory technician at Kalsec, a local spice extraction
  company. She is working with plant breeders to make redder
  paprika and hotter chili peppers. She's enjoying the challenge of
  the work and her co-workers.</p>

  <p><a href=

  src="FitzgeraldChristmas2004_files/image006.jpg"></a>We've been
  at Pine Grove Mennonite Church for a while now. Although we have
  to travel to Battle Creek to attend, we're glad for the friendly
  people, the youth group, and preaching and action from a
  Mennonite perspective. Other snapshots: fun trips to Ithaca (New
  York), Manitoulin Island and Denver; the joy of watching a garden
  Bess thought she was leaving behind grow; Mark winning a
  state-wide award for an architecture project; Will singing shape
  note music; Jane enthusiastically jumping rope, playing video
  games, telling stories and writing poems; Bess's faithful visits
  to Grandma Jane Wend in her Alzheimer's care unit; striving to
  get Kerry elected (he won Michigan, at least); Bess and Will
  celebrating 25 years of marriage (June 17, 2003); Mark traveling
  to Japan with Kalamazoo College's Study Asia program in the
  summer of 2003.</p>

  <p>Merry Christmas! The Fitzgeralds</p>
