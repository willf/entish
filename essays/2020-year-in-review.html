<h3>2020 in review — what a year, hey?</h3>


<p>When President Trump resigned at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Day, we knew that this would be an unusual year. But even the pundits underestimated how unusual it would be! President Trump was, of course, the first president to resign by tweet: “I am sick of your FAKE NEWS and LOSERs! See how you like Pence, you’ll be begging me to come back. I hereby resign resign the Office of the President of the United Strates!” This took everyone by surprise, even Mike Pence, who was hurriedly sworn in as president at 11:31 am by Chief Justice Roberts.

</p><p>Many people think the reason that Trump resigned was his upcoming impeachment trial, with Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell privately signaling that Trump would be convicted. Whether McConnell intentionally leaked his “more than enough to convict is enough to convict” phone conversation with Senate whip John Thune is under debate, but it was effective. Others suggest that the early news coming out of China regarding Covid-19 was going to make being president much less fun. And others were convinced that Pence, in fact, knew about the resignation, and promised Trump a Nixonian pardon, which he received.

</p><p>January brought the first known Covid cases in the United States, and many wondered what impact it would have on the US and on the Pence administration. Pence’s State of the Union address in early February was a bombshell. His “Lift Every Life” initiative, designed to improve the general welfare of American citizens and to plan for what appeared to be a world-wide pandemic received wide praise from both sides of the aisle. His announcement, “The Era of Partisanship now ends; The Era of a United People now begins!” brought about the second longest standing ovation during a SOTU speech, as Democrats and Republicans competed to show everyone that they were the more dedicated. The real surprise came at the end of the speech, when Pence nominated Democrat Joe Biden as his vice-presidential replacement; there were audible gasps, then silence, then the longest standing ovation ever.

</p><p>It came out later that Pence had been secretly meeting with congressional leadership, sharing with them the dire intelligence coming out of China, that Covid would probably lead to a worldwide pandemic, and that the United States needed to come together to prepare for the worst. The broad details of the “Lift Every Life” initiative were hammered out, especially the needed medical and economic responses to a pandemic and a non-punitive and constitutional program to reduce the number of abortions (an important goal of Pence’s, that even the Democrats could support as long as it Republicans dropped their insistence on infringing on abortion rights). But the nomination of Biden was kept a secret until the State of the Union and cemented in people’s minds that Pence was being serious about national unity.

</p><p>Although the nation mourns the more than 1,000 US residents who have died of Covid in 2020, many people think it could have been much worse. Pence swiftly named Dr. Anthony Fauci to head the medical response to Covid, and Nobel prize winning economist Dr. Paul Romer to head the economic response. Fauci and Romer’s “Roadmap for Response and Recovery” plan to rapidly and repeatedly “test and isolate” everyone, money for “warp speed” test and vaccine development, and preparation for personal protective equipment and emergency hospital response was quickly implemented. Was it too much? Some thought so, but quick tests were widely available by March, and prevented much of the economic shutdown that might have been required otherwise, and the hospitals were well-prepared to handle cases. Many parents shuddered to think what it would have meant to close schools for longer than the first three weeks of March, but fortunately it was no longer than that. Similarly, with the shutdown required before the tests were available, but it was short, state and federal aid was quickly passed, and, although the economic growth of the past decade or so was halted for a while, it did not go negative for long. This was due to many things, but the infrastructure jobs created as part of the economic plan succeeded wildly; so much so that Congress quickly implemented an expansion of the guest worker program effectively ending the prosecution of immigration cases. The irony of money being rerouted from Trump’s border wall to other infrastructure projects which then required guest workers was (I think) particularly sweet. 

</p><p>he Black Lives Matter protests of the summer (“Lift Black Lives Too”) began to expose the nation’s failure to address racism in both our history and in the playing out of the Covid-19 response. Although many decried the inadequacy of the response, Vice-President Biden, given the responsibility of overseeing “Lift Every Life,” could naturally extend bipartisan efforts to racial justice. Biden, a Catholic, along with Pence, an Evangelical, reached out to Christian religious conservatives to set goals for reduction in the number of abortions. Some on the far right and far left were unhappy, but most Americans, including Evangelicals and Catholics, were pleased to see real progress being made. 

</p><p>The press began to call it the “New Era of Good Feeling,” and began to speculate what effect it would have on the November elections. Would Trump disrupt things from the sidelines? No; no longer president, social media platforms warned him, and then banned his accounts. Would Pence make a hard right turn? Would Biden run on the Democratic ticket? The announcement of the “Good Feeling” tickets was another surprise: Pence and Biden on the Republic ticket and Biden and Pence on the Democratic one. Pence and Biden campaigned together, raising money for the Covid response instead of on advertising. Their three debates were praised for their clarity and fairness, helping voters understand the choices: slightly less government or slightly more government? Address climate change or ignore it? Address massive income inequality or state that a rising tide lifts all boats?

</p><p>The election was close, as we all remember, in both the popular vote and the electoral college. It all came down to one county, Kent county in Michigan. Because of changes in Michigan election process, the result was not known for twenty-four hours, but, in the end, Biden won by 15,000 votes in Michigan, probably because of his stance on climate change, although Pence’s appointment of Neil Gorsuch to replace Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg was politically savvy. Down-ballot, the Democrats made slight gains in the House, and we are waiting for the runoff elections in Georgia to determine the Senate. Either way, McConnell and Harry Reid (the current minority leader) have pledged to keep the “Good Feeling” going. Observers are calling this the smoothest presidential transfer of power on record. Many of Pence’s cabinet picks will stay on, and Pence will take over Biden’s role as “Good Feeling czar.” 

</p><p>Maybe I’m just being optimistic, but I think this Christmas/Holiday season has been the “jolliest” I can remember. The shipping of the first Covid vaccines approved by the FDA is part of it, of course. People are even wearing their “Lift Every Life” and “Good Feeling” masks as they gather together to party, to worship, to rest and as they travel by bus and train and plane to visit one another.  I know that I, like many others, don’t want this year to end, because we have all but defeated a deadly threat to our nation, together, and come out stronger. May 2021 be even better! I’m hoping that Biden and Pence will address the next big existential crisis: climate change. But, for now, let’s lift our glasses and celebrate a hard but good year.
