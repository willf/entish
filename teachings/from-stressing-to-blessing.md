## From Stressing to Blessing ##

When Doug Troyer called me on Wednesday to ask if I were able to fill in for Kyle Yoder, I said yes, but I didn’t really have a good idea of what to preach on. So, I asked my Facebook friends what I should preach on and got a lot of amazing and interesting suggestions; I am grateful to my friends. One friend from Alabama wrote, “Exactly what God puts on your heart.” And so that is what I am doing. 

You know they say "No one comes to church on Sunday hoping to feel bad about themselves. But I’ve given this sermon the title “From stressing to blessing,” and if we’re going to look at that carefully, we’ll need to say a bit about the things that are stressing us. So, here’s a terrible, horrible list that might make you feel bad.

-	There’s COVID
    - 44 weeks, 4 days since Gov. Whitmer’s first lock down
    - the largest number of deaths from COVID in the US for one day on Tuesday (4,400)
    - Nearly 400,000 total deaths
    - 90 deaths per day in Michigan right now
    - And the vaccine rollout is going slower
 - And there’s the extremely troubling events in Washington
   - an attempted insurrection and coup at the Capitol, with 5 dead, the Capitol invaded and violated with the WP and Congress physically threatened and excrement smeared
   - the second impeachment of Pres. Trump
   - The pending violence-maybe today-in DC and Capitals 
- And then there’s the background of all our lives
  - Our isolation
  - An economy that's being battered
  - The worldwide pandemic
  - The unveiling of racial injustice that can and should shake ourselves about who we are
  - The unsettling effects of climate change
  - the divisions we face in our churches and in the country
  - etc, etc.

This is all very stressing and I apologize. Let’s take a moment of silence in remembrance of those we have lost, and what we have lost.

How can we go from stressing to blessing? 

Bess and I have been studying Isaiah together and I want to touch on a few things from chapter 1. If you have your Bible, maybe you can turn to it. I’ll be reading some portions from it. 

Chapter 1 is mostly a **lament** by God. God is "crying out in grief"

Listen to Isaiah 1:2-5 (NRSV) 

> Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth;  
> for the LORD has spoken:  
> I reared children and brought them up,  
> but they have rebelled against me.  
> 3 The ox knows its owner,  
> and the donkey its master’s crib;  
> but Israel does not know,  
> my people do not understand.  
> 4 Ah, sinful nation,  
> people laden with iniquity,  
> offspring who do evil,  
> children who deal corruptly,  
> who have forsaken the LORD,  
> who have despised the Holy One of Israel,  
> who are utterly estranged!  
> 5 Why do you seek further beatings?  
> Why do you continue to rebel?  
> The whole head is sick,  
> and the whole heart faint.  

And it goes on.

How does God react to the disobedience of the people who call God their God?

By LAMENT. We, who hope to be like God, can and should lament as well.
We are not Israel exactly, but our human condition is similar. So, reading and meditating on these lines are one good response. There is plenty of scripture to help us do so. Especially the Psalms which encourage us to complain to God about our state.

A crying out, and sometimes a good cry or rant is what we need.

But mostly it is to acknowledge how things really are. We can't change unless we know the condition we are in.

By the way, one thing we might try in the depths of our brokenness is joyful worship of God. 

But God explicitly counters that:

Listen to Isaiah 1:11-15 (NRSV) 

> What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?  
> says the LORD;  
> I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams  
> and the fat of fed beasts;  
> I do not delight in the blood of bulls,  
> or of lambs, or of goats.  
> 12 When you come to appear before me,  
> who asked this from your hand?  
> Trample my courts no more;  
> 13 bringing offerings is futile;  
> incense is an abomination to me.  
> New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation—  
> I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity.  
> 14 Your new moons and your appointed festivals  
> my soul hates;  
> they have become a burden to me,  
> I am weary of bearing them.  
> 15 When you stretch out your hands,  
> I will hide my eyes from you;  
> even though you make many prayers,  
> I will not listen;  
> your hands are full of blood.  


God will not accept the prayers of those with blood on their hands.

So, are things bad because we are bad people?

Lett's be honest and say that many of the ills we are experiencing are due to human choice, the "natural consequences" of our actions.

- COVID is worse because of the lack of preparation, and response.
- Our political and church divides are due mostly to a thousand and one decisions we make to divide ourselves-and to be inflamed by others.

But Jesus has two different responses to this question.

Luke 13. 1-5

> 1 At that very time there were some present who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 2 He asked them, “Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? 3 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as they did. 4 Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them—do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem? 5 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish just as they did.”

The Galileans killed by Pilate while worshipping, the 18 who were killed when a tower fell on them--were they worse than the others?

Jesus turns this around from “they” to “you”; from “they” to “us”.

"No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish just as they did."


So, first, LAMENT - AND second, REPENT.

For the Christian, Repentance is an initial act that often proceeds our conversion and baptism.
But it is also our daily obligation. we ' 'must be born again." and then, "We must be born again, again." sometimes, what we are the ones doing the stressing or the oppressing of others. Or profit from that oppression. On an individual and national and "church-wide" basis. 

In Isaiah 1:16 and 17, God speaks out:

> Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean;  
> remove the evil of your doings  
> from before my eyes;  
> cease to do evil,  
> learn to do good;  
> seek justice,  
> rescue the oppressed,  
> defend the orphan,  
> plead for the widow.   

But this isn’t the only answer that Jesus gives to the question, Are these bad things happening because we are bad, He also addresses it in John Chapter 9.

> John 9:1-4a (NRSV) As Jesus walked along, he saw a man blind from birth. 2 His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 3 Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God’s works might be revealed in him. 4 We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day.

Jesus declares that we can use or current difficulties so that the works of God can be revealed -and that we are the ones 'called to do that work in which God may be revealed to others.

So, first LAMENT, second, REPENT, third REORIENT 

This new turn is to orient ourselves to doing the "works of God."

I think this is the secret of going from STRESSING to BLESSING.

I probably played a trick on you. You may have thought I was going to give you a secret trick for going from being stressed to being blessed. "Too blessed to be stressed." as the T-shift says.

NO. I can' t stop the stresses in your life. They are just out there, and they will continue to stress and test you. But-one thing we can do is to choose to not be stressing others.

- Maybe that's as simple as-not posting that anti-Biden or anti-Trump meme on Facebook.
- Maybe it's a little harder-and realizing it's not important to tell everyone just exactly where they are wrong.
- Maybe it's really hard- Maybe someone suggests that "Black Lives Matter" or hints that you might be personally benefit from white privilege. And you remember Isaiah 1 and how God calls even good people to repentance, and rather than strike back, your say, "Help me to understand that better. What does that mean? what can I learn about being a better person?”

We can’t stop the stresses in our lives. And blessing? Rather than calling you to be blessed, I'm calling you to be a blessing to others.

Of course, when you seek to make peace, when you hunger and thirst after righteousness, when you mourn and lament, you will be in a place of blessing, ready to serve God and others.

But don't let this crisis go to waste. who are the orphans and the widows" in your situation? Who do you need to take a new look at with Jesus's eyes instead of your own? How can these terrible days train you to do the work of God?


From stressing others to blessing others—this is one way to think about our new life in Christ.

Though lamenting and repenting and reorienting our lives, great things can be possible.

What is stirring in your heart right now? What sadness, what new choices, what new way to bless others?


Some closing words..

Chinese philosopher Laozi said something similar to what I am trying to say a long time ago.

> Cultivate virtue in yourself,  
> And it will be true.  
> Cultivate virtue in the family,  
> And it will be overflowing.  
> Cultivate virtue in the town,  
> And it will be lasting.  
> Cultivate virtue in the country,  
> And it will be abundant.  
> Cultivate virtue in the world,  
> And it will be universal.  
> Therefore:  
> See others as yourself.  
> See families as your family.  
> See towns as your town.  
> See countries as your country.  
> See worlds as your world.  

God bless you.
