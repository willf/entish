<h1>Introduction</h1></a>

<p>This a a tutorial for writing programs in the C++ language. It's
aimed towards people who have experience writing programs in other
languages, such as Java, Python or Lisp.

<p>C++ is a strongly-typed language that supports object-oriented
programming. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in order to provide
the C language with objects, and it has the reputation of allowing the
programmer to write object-oriented programs that are fast (not, you
may note, the reputation of allowing the programmer to write
object-oriented programs quickly).

<p>Traditionally (if "traditionally" can be used for something so
recently created), C++ was taught either as the first object-oriented
language students or programmers learned, or as a step up from C. More
and more, however, people are learning programming by using Java or
other languages, and this leaves a gap to the programmer who knows how
to program well, but, for whatever reason, wants to learn or use
C++. This "real, quick" guide to C++ is not a reference guide to C++,
but a quick introduction to C++ using realistic programs. It's divided
into four sections: first, we demonstrate C++ by writing a simple (but
realistic) program to count character frequencies in a text; second,
we describe how to define classes and objects in C++ and do a little
software development; third, we discuss memory management and a
inheritance; and fourth, we provide a series of pointers to other
resources for learning C++.

<p>If you have comments or corrections about this C++ tutorial, I'd be
glad to hear them--just write me at <a href="mailto:will.fitzgerald@pobox.com">will.fitzgerald@pobox.com</a>.
