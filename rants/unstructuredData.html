  <h1>1&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h1>

  <p>These are answers to questions posed by my friend Daniel
  Lemire who is preparing a course on information retrieval and
  unstructured data.</p><a name="node_sec_2" id="node_sec_2"></a>

  <h1>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Current position and biography</h1>

  <p><i>What is your current position and affiliation? What other
  positions did you held in the recent past? Feel free to give a
  short bio.</i></p>

  <p>I am currently a Research Scientist at NASA&rsquo;s <a href=
  "http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html">Ames Research
  Center</a>, where I work on autonomy architecture (that is,
  getting things&ndash;in our case, helicopters&ndash;to do things
  on their own&ndash;in our case, fly around and take pictures of
  things without crashing). Just prior to this, I worked at the
  Canadian National Research Council&rsquo;s <a href=
  "http://iit-iti.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/locations-bureaux/fredericton_f.html">
  Institute for Information Technology centre in New Brunswick</a>,
  where I worked on translation technologies. I have also worked in
  a number of start up companies working on (among other things)
  language technologies.</p><a name="node_sec_3" id=

  <h1>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Unstructured text</h1>

  <p><i>What is unstructured data and why should an organization
  care about it?</i></p>

  <p>The flip answer is that it is data which doesn&rsquo;t have
  any structure. But, of course, this can not be the case: the only
  truly unstructured data would be data generated by some kind of
  random process. Typically, &ldquo;unstructured data&rdquo; means
  data that do not have (SQL) database schemata defined for them
  for a particular purpose. So, a database of the names and
  addresses of job applicants is likely to be structured, but the
  resumes the applicants sent it is likely to be unstructured.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s often said that some large percentage of an
  institution&rsquo;s information is unstructured data&ndash;just
  check out this Google search pattern: <a href=
  "http://www.google.com/search?q=percent+%22is+unstructured+data%22">
  percent "unstructured data"</a>. Getting at information buried in
  this data can be crucial to the needs of a company or
  institution.</p>

  <p>Much of this data are in documents, and the term <a href=
  "http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hearst/papers/acl99/acl99-tdm.html">
  <i>text mining</i></a> is often used for this important
  subset.</p>

  <p>Almost all of the information available on the world wide web
  is unstructured data, of course. In fact, many say that the
  explosion of information available on the web is due to how easy
  it is to put data out on the web without having to carefully
  structure it first.</p><a name="node_sec_4" id="node_sec_4"></a>

  <h1>4&nbsp;&nbsp;Research into &ldquo;unstructured
  data&rdquo;</h1>

  <p><i>Please tell us about some of your research results and
  major contributions in the field of &ldquo;unstructured
  data&rdquo;?</i></p>

  <p>Because this field is so broad, I wouldn&rsquo;t consider that
  I&rsquo;m an &ldquo;unstructured data&rdquo; researcher. Still,
  there are two areas that relate to unstructured data
  research.</p>

  <p>One general area relates to using signals in the data to get
  qualitative descriptions of the data out. In my work on
  multimodal user interfaces, for example, I&rsquo;ve created a
  modeling language for describing how time-varying events can
  predict user intentions. See, for example, our paper <a href=
  "http://www.entish.org/published/P2338-fitzgerald.pdf">Multimodal
  Event Parsing for Intelligent User Interfaces</a>. This describes
  a system that allows system designers to &ldquo;parse&rdquo; the
  events that come into a system in real-time in order to
  understand user intentions and other qualitative descriptions of
  the data. My more recent work has been in refining this concept,
  based (I think) on better models of the underlying data. Not much
  has been published on this yet, but if you&rsquo;re really
  interested, you can read a recent technical conference paper
  <a href=
  "http://www.entish.org/published/freed-et-al-05.pdf">&ldquo;An
  architecture for intelligent management of aerial observation
  missions&rdquo;</a>. This really focuses on the autonomy area,
  but the appendix has hints, at least, on the monitoring/parsing
  language we are developing at Ames. One piece of this theory is
  in the paper written with Daniel Lemire and Martin Brooks
  <a href="http://www.entish.org/published/fitzgerald-lemire-brooks-05.pdf">
  Quasi-monotonic segmentation of state variable behavior for
  reactive control</a>. In anything, these paper show both the wide
  applicability of these approaches, and how difficult it is to
  come up with just the right models!</p>

  <p>But here&rsquo;s an easier example of this: determining the
  language in which a text is written. For example, is the
  following text French or English:</p>

  <blockquote>
    A truly great book should be read in youth, again in maturity
    and once more in old age, as a fine building should be seen by
    morning light, at noon and by moonlight. - Robertson Davies
  </blockquote>

  <p>It turns out to be relatively easy to do so, even without a
  dictionary of English and French words. Take a large corpus of
  English text, and one in French, and count how frequently
  <em>n</em>-grams of letters occur in each. (An
  &ldquo;<em>n</em>-gram&rdquo; is just a combination of <em>n</em>
  letters). For example, in a bigram character model,
  &lsquo;th&rsquo; is very frequent in English, &lsquo;le&rsquo; is
  less so; the opposite is true in French. <em>N</em>-gram seem to
  follow a &ldquo;Zipf&rsquo;s law&rdquo; distribution (in fact,
  Zipf based his original research on this). There are a number of
  formulations of Zipf&rsquo;s law. Here&rsquo;s one:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><em>r</em><sup>1/<em>r</em><tt>-</tt>1</sup> approx
        <em>r</em><sup><tt>-</tt><em>a</em></sup></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>where <em>r</em> is the <i>rank</i> of the item counted
  (<i>i.e.</i>, it&rsquo;s order in a sorting based on its
  frequency, and <em>a</em> is an empirical constant. To make use
  of these facts, there are two stages, a training stage, and the
  testing stage. From each corpus, I identify the relative
  frequency of each <em>n</em>-gram in the corpus. I treat the
  relative frequency as a probability
  <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, and calculate each
  <em>n</em>-gram&rsquo;s information value,
  <em>i</em><em>v</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = <tt>-</tt>
  <em>l</em><em>g</em>(<em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>) (this gives
  the number of bits needed to most efficiently encode the
  <em>n</em>-gram in the corpus; treating the corpus as the
  &ldquo;population,&rdquo; it gives the most efficient encoding,
  <i>in general</i> for texts in that language. Then, to test which
  language a probe text is in, I sum the information value of the
  text in each of the languages; the one with the lowest
  information value is the best guess.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Code-switching&rdquo; is the term sociolinguists use to
  describe the phenomenon of a person switches from one language to
  another. The research problem is to identify code-switching
  within document. So, this becomes a micro-language identification
  problem. Consider this type of sentence familiar enough to
  Canadians, if not people in the U.S.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Bonjour! S&rsquo;il vous plait, leave a message at the sound of
    the tone. Merci.
  </blockquote>Starts in French, switches to English. How can
  character <em>n</em>-grams be used to identify where the switch
  occurs? Note in particular that &ldquo;message&rdquo; is a word
  in both English and French, which suggests that knowing the
  probability of language identification of a (short) string is
  important (<i>i.e.</i>, we can&rsquo;t just depend on the
  &ldquo;best guess&rdquo;). But one can take &ldquo;sliding
  windows&rdquo; of text, and calculate the best guess for each of
  these, and make guesses thereby of where switches in language
  occur. (Note for example, that the word &ldquo;message&rdquo; is
  both a word in French and English, so we&rsquo;ll need some
  statistical techniques and/or heuristics to decide whether a
  switch in fact occurs.

  <p>A second area is using dynamic planning for parsing
  conversations in real time by making only weak commitments to the
  models used while parsing. A workshop paper, <a href=
  "http://www.entish.org/published/descriptions-add-value.pdf">Item
  descriptions add value to plans.</a>. More closely related to
  text mining is a relatively early paper which used a model of
  typical questions asked/questions answered to create hypertext
  systems&ndash;See <a href=
  "http://www.entish.org/published/fitzgerald-wisdo.pdf">Using
  natural language processing to construct large-scale hypertext
  systems</a>.</p><a name="node_sec_5" id="node_sec_5"></a>

  <h1>5&nbsp;&nbsp;History and Future</h1>

  <p><i>How did the management of unstructured data evolved in the
  current years and what factors contributed to this evolution?
  What are the major difficulties in information retrieval and what
  big discoveries are yet to be made?</i></p>

  <p>The most important factor has been the explosion of
  information available on the world wide web. It is hard to
  overestimate the importance of this. Here are some interesting
  present challenges in information retrieval:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><i>Dealing with untrustworthy data</i>. Unscrupulous
      people are constantly placing untrustworthy data on the web.
      For example, web robots attempt to place comments on <a href=
      "http://www.entish.org/willwhim">my weblog</a> entries in
      order to fool the search engines on how important other
      websites are. In fact, entire weblogs are &ldquo;weblog
      spam.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re all familiar with email spam. What
      are good techniques for dealing with this?</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><i>The size of the web</i>. How large is the web? How much
      of it has a search engine indexed? This is a recent
      controversy with conflicting claims by Yahoo, Google and
      Microsoft. An NCSA study <a href=
      "http://vburton.ncsa.uiuc.edu/indexsize.html">A Comparison of
      the Size of the Yahoo! and Google Indices</a> compared Yahoo
      and Google. On the one hand, they examined actual results
      returned from the search engines; on the other, they
      investigated only English searches. The later makes it very
      unlikely to report a comparison fairly. Jean
      Veronis has written a series of posts examining
      reported results from Google, Yahoo and MSN. For example, one
      looks at whether Yahoo is indexing 19 billion pages&ndash;see
      <a href=
      "http://aixtal.blogspot.com/2005/08/yahoo-19-milliards-de-pages.html">
      his post</a>. This has raised a lot of questions about, for
      example, what counts as a &rdquo;page.&rdquo; His posts are
      well worth reading.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><i>Tagging</i>. Many sites, such as Flickr, are allowing
      users to &ldquo;tag&rdquo; entries with their own keywords.
      These are not connected to any formal system or ontology. And
      it seems to work pretty well for retrieval.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><i>The Long Tail</i>. The Zipf&rsquo;s Law distribution
      (or similar distributions) mentioned above seems to come up
      again and again. For example, the most popular songs in
      Apple&rsquo;s iTunes catalog are very, very popular, but
      it&rsquo;s been claimed that every song in the catalog has
      been sold at least once. See the excellent graph at Chris
      Anderson&rsquo;s <a href=
      "http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2005/07/updated_data.html">
      Long tail weblog</a> for music data from the Rhapsody
      service. The interesting search question is how find
      interesting things in the &ldquo;long tail,&rdquo; where it
      is theoretically harder to find them.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><i>Issues of time</i>. Increasingly, the web is &ldquo;out
      of date,&rdquo; meaning that the state of a webpage (say)
      changes from one access to another. For example, the NCSA
      study referenced above was changed after criticisms were made
      of it, and one of the author&rsquo;s names was dropped (this
      is reported in the paper, but I believe it was not there at
      first). And, of course, web address change, items are moved,
      and it&rsquo;s hard to find them again. I think this adds an
      interesting temporal aspect to the question of information
      retrieval: it&rsquo;s not only important to know <i>where</i>
      to find something, but <i>at what point in time</i> it was
      originally created, modified, etc.</p>
