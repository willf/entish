I am not a Wise One, so warning: Here There Be Unschooled Music Theory. 

It seems to me there are two fuguing sections in the first half of the Greet Street. 
(i.e., the part of the tune on page 198 of Denson), in the first five measures, then 
the next six measures. It's B^T A^S (in Annie's notation), then T^S B^A. 
The fugue starts, then restarts and leads into the closing of the first half with its hold. 

Then, bang--you get back into the tune, all together, and then split apart--it's a 
reverse fugue, if there's such a thing; but then one gets the symmetry of coming 
together again with *another* short fugue to the finish of first time through. Where 
the 'reverse fugue' and the 'fugue' begins is a little unclear and kind of cool 
therefore. And here's another cool thing: the symmetry is broken by jumping back to 
the closing measures of the fugue proper of the first half, and you have that hold 
again. Sing the reverse fugue, sing the final fugue, and finish together. You're 
always a little off center, but you never fall over. 

So, to hallucinate some representation, let F be a fugue section, C be a closing section, 
P be a 'plain' section, and R be a reverse fugue with an opening section O, 
with numbers referring to measures. ':' marks the end of the first time through. 
I hope this will be readable to you, but if not, I put a copy at

Compare this to a canonical fugue, Northfield (155) sung with a repeat:

         1         2
12345678901234567890
P---F----C-:F----C--

And you can see a bit of the beauty and complexity of Green Street; better sung than 
read, of course!
