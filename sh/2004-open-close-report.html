  <h3>Opening and closing tune choices in 2004 Sacred Harp
  singings</h3>

  <p>I did a frequency analysis of the tunes led as either the
  opening, or the closing, tune during the 222 singings reported in
  the 2004 minutes book.</p>

  <p>Here are the songs most frequently led as an opening song
  (five or more times):</p>

  <p>The following songs, not in the Denson book, etc., were sung
  once each as closing songs: "I Cannot Find My Way Alone," "Not
  Made with Hands," "Sweet Beulah Land," "The Christian's
  Love."</p>

  <p>There were 82 different songs led as opening songs, and 81
  songs led as closing songs. Both show a 'long-tail' frequency
  distribution (a few songs chosen a lot; many songs chosen a few
  times), with the closing song distribution dropping off more
  sharply than the opening songs--the frequency almost perfect
  halves each time in the numbers given above. My analysis of song
  selections overall from the Denson book in 2002 also manifests
  this long-tail distribution. (I hope to report on overall song
  selections for 2004 soon).</p>

  <p>The 'traditional' opening and closing songs--Holy Manna and
  Parting Hand--are, in fact, the most commonly selected. Still,
  it's interesting that other songs are chosen over 70% of the
  time. Eight singings led with Holy Manna and closed with Parting
  Hand--less than 4% of the singings.</p>

  Hand...)</p>
