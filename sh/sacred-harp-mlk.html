 <hr />
<p><a name=title-note href=#title>1</a>: This is a highly eclectic list. It has songs of 'the Beloved Community,' calls to a life of service, songs of freedom,  the current journey together, and hope for a just world. The Funeral Anthem is a good memorial text. A couple tunes are, I think, derived from spirituals; I'd be glad to know more about this.  Thanks to Linda, Amanda Denson, Gerry Hoffman, and Robert Vaughan for suggestions and encouragement.
