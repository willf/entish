<p>Some tunes, e.g., Eden of Love, have inconsistent accidentals.  Earlier editions tended to use
more diachromatic scales, with few (if any) accidentals.  Later in the 18th century accidentals
were often added (especially in minor keys), but inconsistently.  For a more primitive sound, one
might try dropping accidentals wherever possible.
