But here he marvels at an unlucky patron who was arrested twice in the span of about a week. It was Marilyn vos Savant who pointed out that, although flipping a coin ten times and getting ten heads was as likely as any other permutation, if you did see ten heads in a row, you should be suspicous of the coin. Similarly, I suspect what happened here is that the odds are stacked against those whom the Chicago police target for solicitation: if you look <a href="http://www.chicagopolice.org/ps/list.aspx">at the pictures</a>, they seem <em>prima facie</em> to more likely be people of color or less well-to-do than average; I suspect the real bad luck in this case was to be born black, poor and female (or transgendered).</p>
