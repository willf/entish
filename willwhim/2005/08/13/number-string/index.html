<p>Fer instance: automatic conversion of strings to numbers. What happens when evaluating <code>10 + &quot;10&quot;</code>? I wish I could have the four hours of my life back that I spent tracking down a bug which turned out to be caused by my forgetting this was a problem. (I was reading in an XML file, which included digits that Javascript <em>wasn’t</em> converting to numbers as I assumed. Grr, I have a PhD in computer science and I (was stupid enough to forget this | have to deal with ‘stone knives and bearskins’)?</p>
<p>Note to self: Javascript converts numbers to strings when using ‘+’ (which adds numbers, but concatenates strings); for other math operations, it converts strings to numbers.</p>

<p>I was explaining to Bess, my wife, what the problem was, and she didn’t seem to be listening, so I apologized for boring her. She said that it wasn’t that so much, but that she just didn’t understand the technical issues. I assured her that if she did understand the technical issues, she would still be bored.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way–with all the hype about <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a>, you think it would be a little easier to discover how various vendors have implemented  <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, and that it can be called synchronously as well as asynchronously. I don’t really think it’s true that “the core Ajax technologies are mature, stable, and well understood.” But this is fodder for another essay.</p>
