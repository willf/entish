<p>Your English version of Borges’ celebrated essay <a href="http://www.entish.org/essays/Wilkins.html">http://www.entish.org/essays/Wilkins.html</a> contains a rather spectacular mistranslation based presumably on a typo in the original Spanish. Section 16 of Wilkins’ taxonomy classifies the *whale*, not beauty, as a viviparous oblong fish. There is a complete text online at <a href="http://reliant.teknowledge.com/Wilkins">http://reliant.teknowledge.com/Wilkins</a>, and the relevant passage is on page 132. The confusion seems to arise from the graphic similarity between “ballena” (whale) and “belleza” (beauty) in Spanish. I cannot imagine that Borges himself did not know the difference, but I have no idea where the error first arose.
Hmm. I based my translation on the Spanish original at <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/wilkins.html"><a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/wilkins.html">http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/wilkins.html</a></a>. It has belleza/beauty. Douglas Crockford’s <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/wilkins.html">Spanish version and translation</a> has ballena/whale. I looked for other online copies of the Spanish original: <a href="http://www.coloradocollege.edu/idprog/ComparativeLiterature/beginning.html">a comp lit site</a> has “belleza.” Another <a href="http://www.shareeducation.com.ar/Language%20and%20Literacy/LANGUAGE%20AND%20LITERACY%203_2001.htm">Language and Literacy post</a> (one has to scroll down quite a bit) has “belleza/beauty.” This <a href="http://ndirty.cute.fi/~karttu/tekstit/wilkins.htm">Finnish site</a> has “belleza.” I don’t have a Spanish print edition of <em>Otras Inquisiciones</em> to check.</p>

<p>Perhaps Borges was using a <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=en_es&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Freliant.teknowledge.com%2FWilkins%2FCleanText%2Fp132.html">Babelfish translation</a>. Seriously, I’m curious whether Borges was using a bad translation, or just had an eye for ‘beauty.’ This might mean I have to actually go to a physical library to find out …</p>
