    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>“Stafford” is a tune in the <a href="http://fasola.org/index/0Index.html">Sacred Harp</a>. It’s a <a href="http://users3.ev1.net/~amity/78.htm">pretty tune</a>, I think. It is periodicially the proximate cause of discussions on the Sacred Harp mailing list because of the <a href="http://fasola.org/index/L/078.html">lyrics</a> to which it is set in in the Sacred Harp:</p>
<p>See what a living stone The builders did refuse, Yet God hath built His Church thereon, In spite of env’ous Jews.</p>
<p>The sticking point is, of course, the last phrase: “envious Jews.” The lyrics are by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Watts">Isaac Watts</a>, an early 18th century English writer who wrote over 600 hymn texts and two books on logic. He wrote “Joy to the world,” and the poem, “How doth the little busy bee” parodied by Lewis Carroll as “<a href="http://eir.library.utoronto.ca/rpo/display/poem437.html">How doth the little crocodile</a>.” The discussion has been wide rannging and mostly respectful and on-topic (despite a tripping of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin’s law</a> in one of the first emails). Kiri Miller has a chapter on an earlier iteration of this discussion in her yet unpublished dissertation, “A Long Time Traveling: Song, Memory, and the Politics of Nostalgia in the Sacred Hard Diaspora,” which I think is quite good (both the dissertation in general and this chapter in particular).</p>
<p>Anyway, in the middle of the night I started writing a replacement lyric which would simultaneously do several things: First, to honor Watts and his contribution to Christian hymnody. Second, to ‘repair’ the lyric of its purported anti-semitism, and make it ‘pro-semitic,’ as it were. (After all, if the first Christians were Jews, and the first Christians sang, then the first Christians were singing Jews). Third, to describe the longing I have to sing the praises of God in ‘harmony,’ both literally and in peace with my fellow singers. So I wrote this:</p>
<p>I seek an angel choir To join in fearful praise As Moses and as Miriam sang With all the trembling saints.</p>
<p>The first and last lines are acrostics. It also links Sacred Harp singing to what I believe is the earliest recorded song of praise in the Bible (Exodus 15) as well as to when ‘the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy’ (Job 38:7, KJV). Suggestions for enhancements willingly accepted!</p>
<p>I posted a similar note on the Sacred Harp discussion list, and some balked at the ‘fearful.’ But this comes more or less directly from <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus%2015&amp;version=9">the King James text of Exodus 15</a>: “Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?” Still, I might change it to “awe-filled.”</p>
