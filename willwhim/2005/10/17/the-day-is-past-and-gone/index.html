There were only six people when we began to sing, but with Roger Williams singing bass, Molly Williams on alto, and Ann Miczulski singing treble, and the always strong leading tenor of Samuel Sommers, we were well covered. We started with lots of minor plain tunes–<a href="http://fasola.org/index/L/049b.html">Mear</a>, <a href="http://fasola.org/index/L/028b.html">Wells</a> and the like. We sang <a href="http://fasola.org/index/L/078.html">Stafford</a>, the object of some controversy because of its words, because some of us didn’t even know how it sounded (with some instructions on how to change the words, and explicit permission not to sing). It’s a pretty tune, but I’m not sure we gave it justice on what was basically a first singing for many of us. Sam Sommers led us though <a href="http://fasola.org/index/L/268.html">David’s Lamentation</a>, singing it in 2/4 time as written–that is, about twice as fast as it is often sung, but the time signature given it by Billings, its composer. Opinions were somewhat divided as to whether this was a good thing or not. We finished with <a href="http://fasola.org/index/L/209.html">Evening Shade</a>, and I choked up a bit at the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day is past and gone, The evening shades appear; Oh may we all remember well, The night of death is near. We lay our garments by, Upon our beds to rest: So death will soon disrobe us all, Of what we here possess.
because I spent much of the weekend with my father, Harold Fitzgerald, who had to go to the hospital on Thursday because of a bad infection he got at his nursing home.</p>
