<p>[O]ne should very much like to know how it has come to pass that many of those who feel qualified to judge intellectual eminence take it as a revelation that the United State of America is an imperial power which has committed, supported and denied atrocities all over the world, or that centralizing the news media in the hands of large, advertising-supported corporations, owned in whole or in part by other huge companies, leads to bias. These are important facts, of course, and they are news to many people. (From <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/chomsky.html">On Chomsky: “Study in Total Depravity”</a>).
Empires commit horrible acts, and the US was and is an empire; but average reader of the New York Times, much less the St. Louis Post-Dispatch or watcher of the nightly news, would know very little of this. (From <a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notabene/chomsky.html">Noam Chomsky</a>).</p>
