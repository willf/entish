<p>I also got to visit friend and colleagues <a href="http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/">Daniel Lemire</a> and Anna MacLaughlin, with whom I worked at the Canadian National Research Council, which was great fun. The weather was clear and cold, but we hit a major winter storm on our way home, forcing us to stay an extra night in a hotel on the way back. All in all, a good trip, and a chance to brush up on some of my favourite aspects of <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/">Canadian culture</a>.</p>
