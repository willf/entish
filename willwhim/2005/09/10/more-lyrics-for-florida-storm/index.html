<p>I thought that Florida Storm was protected by copyright, but now I believe it is in the public domain, having been written in 1928. So here are the complete lyrics (according to <a href="http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=72422">this thread</a> on <a href="http://www.mudcat.org">Mudcat</a>:</p>
<p>September eighteenth, nineteen hundred and twenty-six, The people cried mercy in the storm, Their cries were too late their crying was in vain, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.</p>
<p>Chorus: The people cried mercy in the storm, The people cried mercy in the storm, The colored and the white stay’d awake all the night, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.</p>
<p>A pity and a shame all the people in the rain, But God show’d His mercy in the storm, It was very sad that they lost all they had, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>The wind with a mighty sound laid many building down, But God show’d His mercy in the storm, Night comes on you know they had no where to go, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>The streets were all a mess it was so no one could pass, Mothers look’d for children in the storm, Fathers tried in vain it was a shame I know, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>The doctors got the news so many that were bruised, Together with the Red Cross on the train, They all came in haste to see about their case, Crying, Lord have mercy in the storm.</p>
