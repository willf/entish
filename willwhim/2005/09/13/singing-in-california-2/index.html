The biggest problem is the longish drive in heavy traffic up to Berkeley on top of a day that starts at 5 am Michigan time. I arrived quite tired, and made many silly mistakes–flubbing even New Britian (Amazing Grace) and calling “Southwell” “Southfield”–a Michigan city, as Mark pointed out. (I had visions of someone putting Eminem’s <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/8mile.html">8 Mile</a> to a Sacred Harp tune; perhaps on the way to creating a musical genre–call it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton">Sacreton</a>). Still, it was great to sing–<a href="http://unknownstrains.blogspot.com/2005/09/singing-and-teaching.html">Natalia</a> thought the group singing was ‘lovely’ so it wasn’t a complete loss.</p>
