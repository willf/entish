Descriptions of binary tree sorting/searching algorithms, such as the excellent <a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~clr/">Introduction to Algorithms</a>, state that items to be sorted have to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_order">strictly ordered</a>, which means you can’t have duplicates in the tree. But this is easily solved by storing duplicates together in the same binary tree node. “The implementing sets” article suggests adding a ‘count’ field to the node, which marks how many copies are in the node. Often, though, the key and value of a node are different–which suggests that (if the values are strictly ordered as well) you can use the same kind of binary tree to store values. Often it is the <em>insertion order</em> that matters, in which case this can be used as a key.</p>
