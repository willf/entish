My biggest fear was that Disney would tinker with the story too much; this fear was unfounded. It’s a respectful and fairly faithful telling of the <em>Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em>. Aslan is still not a <em>tame lion</em>, and is <em>good, not safe</em>, and Professor Kirke still wonders <em>What do they teach at schools these days?</em> I doubt that the movie will evoke much <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sehnsucht<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Disney’s Narnia isn’t a place I yearn to visit, nor does it evoke a sense of nostalgic longing for my true home. On the other hand, I did sit next to a very young child–perhaps three years old–who ask his mother, “Is this a <em>true</em> story?” I doubt this movie will set mermaids singing for many, or prompt many to learn that <em>if you become Christ’s you will stumble upon wonder upon wonder and every wonder true</em> (attributed to St. Brendan of Birr in this list of quotations on <a href="http://www.spiritualityhealth.com/newsh/items/blank/item_314.html">wonder</a>). All in all, not a bad movie, and it taught me a few things: for example, centaurs can wield two swords in battle because they don’t need reins, and the evoking of the Nazi bombing of England was better than the book’s. Worth seeing (perhaps only after having read the books), but even with all of its CGI magic, not wonderful.</p>
