<p><em>Update:</em> She was demoted for <em>shoplifting</em>. A revised article at <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-1601031,00.html">The London Times</a> says, “The Army announced that the demotion was based on a broad charge of dereliction of duty, essentially clearing her of direct responsibility for the abuse at Abu Ghraib prison.”</p>
