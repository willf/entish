Kalamazoo was the world headquarters of the Upjohn Company, which merged with Pharmacia and then swallowed by Pfizer. This doesn’t bode well for Kalamazoo’s long term future. A local hobby shop, Rider’s, <a href="http://www.mlive.com/printer/printer.ssf?/base/business-2/1121509246149180.xml">recently announced they are going out of business</a>: the manager said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We survived the close of the General Motors plant, but the layoffs and job transfers at Pfizer really hurt us. and this was the <em>earlier</em> round of layoffs at Pfizer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governor Granholm is trying to negotiate the creation of a 3 billion dollar R&amp;D fund with the Republican dominated legislature; she’s also traveling to Japan to woo Toyota to build plants in Michigan (here’s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000101&amp;sid=a0HnSJe23HbM&amp;refer=japan">an article on the trip and the fund</a>). Michigan is tied with Mississippi for the highest unemployment: it’s just possible that these efforts will help.</p>
