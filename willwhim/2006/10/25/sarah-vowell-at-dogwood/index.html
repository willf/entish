She read from her books for about half the time, and took questions the other half–about 45 minutes each. I enjoyed her most when she was slightly off script while reading–making side comments of various sorts about the topic at hand. I’d just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/explorer/0743260031/2/ref=pd_lpo_ase/102-7933339-0372936?">Assassination Vacation</a> on the plane back from vacation (her generally delightful book about the assassinations of Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley as well as their assassinators).</p>
<p>One point she made that I want to ponder: the president makes an oath “to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,” but Bush has been gutting various Constitutional notions in the name of safety.</p>
<p>The trees on the way to Dowagiac were beautiful. Dowagiac itself seems like a thriving small town; its middle school (where the talk was held) is very fine. And Dowagiac has its own <a href="http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/D/DOWAGIAC.html">soil series</a> (but so does <a href="http://ortho.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/K/KALAMAZOO.html">Kalamazoo</a>).</p>
