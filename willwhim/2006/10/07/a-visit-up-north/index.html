<p>Even cooler, Ed bought an old firetruck from the Baldwin fire department. He hopes to put a pick on it to get up higher in the trees. That’s my nephew Davie on top. <a href="http://www.entish.org/images/davie_and_trees_large.jpg"><img src="http://www.entish.org/images/davie_and_trees.jpg" alt="Eddie looking down from truck" title="Eddie looking down from truck"></a></p>
<p>A closer view on Davie (click on image for a larger view)–he’s as cute as Ed was when he was a little boy.</p>
<p>It was a glorious fall day. Ed cut up the last watermelon from the garden. We had good conversations with family–Ed, Amy, Davie; Dave and Joanie. (I forgot to get any pictures at Dave and Joanie’s house). The fall colors were nice, and the <em>Tigers beat the Yankees to win the AL division series.</em></p>
