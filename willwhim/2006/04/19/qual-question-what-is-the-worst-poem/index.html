Seamus Cooney has a <a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/~cooneys/poems/bad/">Bad Poetry</a> page, but there isn’t much that’s truly awful there, except perhaps, <a href="http://homepages.wmich.edu/~cooneys/poems/bad/Julia.Moore.et.al.html">Kalamazoo</a> (bottom of page) by JB Smiley:</p>
<p>Kalamazoo</p>
<p>On the outskirts are celery marshes Which only a few years ago Were as wet as a drugstore in Kansas And as worthless as marshes could grow, Well some genius bethought him to drain them And to add in a short year or two About eighty-five thousand dollars To the income of Kalamazoo.</p>
<p>The Michigan Insane Asylum Is up on the top of the hill, And some irresponsible crazies Meander around there at will, And they frequently talk to a stranger, And they sometimes escape, it is true, But the folks are not all of them crazy Who hail from Kalamazoo.</p>
<p>I tried to convince Jane that the Sacred Harp poem <a href="http://fasola.org/index/L/334.html">O Come Away</a> was truly awful, but she so dislikes Sacred Harp, she can’t even think of it as bad:</p>
<p>Oh come, come away, From the labor now reposing, Our jubilee has set us free — Oh come, come away! Come, hail the day that celebrates The ransom of th’inebriates From all that does intoxicate, Oh come, come away!</p>
<p>We welcome you here! With heart and hand wide open, Ye gallant sons of temperance — We welcome you here! Heav’n’s blessings on your plans, we pray! Ye come our sinking friends to save, And rescue from a drunkard’s grave; We welcome you here!</p>
<p>We welcome you here! Ye who with taste perverted Have seized the cup, and drank it up — We welcome you here! Come, join us in our holy aim, The poor besotted to reclaim, The broken heart to cheer again, Oh come, sign the pledge!</p>
<p>(It does have a rollicking <a href="http://users3.ev1.net/~amity/334.htm">tune</a>, though).</p>
<p>Among people <em>trying</em> to write bad poetry, we liked <a href="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/91q2/lguppy.html">Love guppy</a>, too long to repeat here. But I prefer the lyrics to “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printables/shouts/060410sh_shouts">Hump my hump</a>“:</p>
<p>Hump my hump, My stumpy lumpy hump! Hump my dump, you lumpy slumpy dump! I’ll dump your hump, and then just hump your dump, You lumpy frumply clump.</p>
<p>(Though the rest of the article isn’t fit for pure eyes). Ok, qual takers out there: what’s the worst poem?</p>
