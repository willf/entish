I’m not a fan of Bush’s faith-based initiatives. As a Christian, I am a big fan of the separation of church and state, because I’ve seen what happens when the power of the state fuses with the church. Yet, it  seems to me that the example use of ‘faith-based’ given above, and its linking to Bush in the usage note, is more editorial (as in opinion) than exemplary (as in representative).</p>
