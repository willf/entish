<p>We purchased a Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach Easyglide Pro Freshmint Floss, and have had the following problems: – there is so much wax on the floss, it is hard to use because it slips in our hands, – there is so much wax on the floss, it is hard to get between our teeth, – it is almost impossible to cut the floss using the included cutter, – the cutter and feeder are poorly attached to the body, and so collapsed when trying to cut the floss, – the idea of having a ‘pro’ floss stikes us as silly as best and insulting at worst, – we resent having to pay extra for non-functioning products (often, we are unable to purchase J&amp;J’s basic waxed floss because stores do not carry it). We would be glad if J&amp;J refunded our money for this inferior product, and if J&amp;J could make stronger efforts to ensure availability of their basic waxed floss product.
