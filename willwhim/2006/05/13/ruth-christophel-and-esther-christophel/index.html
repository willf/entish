I’m sure I’m not the only one who burst into tears on hearing of her death. Her printed obituary says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Esther was [a] homemaker who lived for her family and those in need. She was a member of Pine Grove Mennonite Church, where she had taught Sunday school, was a former song leader and sent cards to shut-ins and the sick. She was also a member of the former Kellogg Community College Eclectic Coral, now known as Echoes of Grace and she volunteered at the Marian Burch Adult Day Care Center. Esther had a very outgoing personality and made new friends easily; and she enjoyed photography and vegetable and flower gardening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among those she cared for was her mother-in-law Ruth. Among the many sad things in the timing of her death is that after years of caring for her mother-in-law, she will be unable to spend her later years with her beloved husband Eldon, nor he with her. I can’t imagine the grief of losing both your mother and your wife in a fortnight’s time.</p>
<p>May God console Eldon and the extended Chirstophel family in their grief. I imagine Esther singing in God’s vast multi-ethnic choir, excited and joyful about the new tunes she is learning, the new ways of praising the God she loves.</p>
