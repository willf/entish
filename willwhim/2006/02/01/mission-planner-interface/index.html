<p>As part of the <a href="http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/projects/apex/projectARP.php">Autonomous Rotorcraft Project</a>, I was the main developer on the <a href="http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/projects/apex/projectARPMissionPlannerInterface.php">Mission Planner Interface</a> (MPI). It’s a browser-based tool (requiring Firefox 1.5, Safari, or the latest Opera beta) that allows definition of observation targets that are sent off to the mission planner, which then creates a plan to visit all of the targets and then controls the heliocopter as it carries out the mission. One cool technical trick is that the MPI uses the new-fangled ‘Ajax’ ideas to talk to the <a href="http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/projects/apex/index.php">plan execution system</a> (well, talks to a server that talks to the system) so that, for example, the position of the helicopter is shown on the map, and to provide pan-and-zoom features (a la Google Maps). Another cool trick is using the new <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#canvas">canvas</a> feature in the above browsers to draw paths on the map. Yet another cool thing: you can <a href="http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/projects/apex/mpi/html/mission.html">play with a demo</a> that runs a simulation of the mission planner. Drop down some observation targets, press ‘Send’, and watch the tiny helicopter fly around the screen–all in Javascript!</p>
