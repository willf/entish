I’m looking forward to working with Tim again. We’ve had interesting working relationships in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>He worked for me writing code to parse RAP System execution code under C++,</li>
<li>I worked for him (and Joyce Park) doing webdev using <a href="http://www.mactech.com/news/?p=1000133">Dynamorph</a>, an unlamented language that preceded JSP and PHP and Ruby on Rails.</li>
<li>When he and Joyce were living a <a href="http://timconverse.com/blog/index.php?/archives/69_Welcome_us_to_the_Bay_Area.html">semi-entrepreneurial lifestyle</a> in Chicago, I was a semi-advisor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since he left for the Bay area, I’ve had hopes that someday we might work together again. I didn’t expect that it would happen in this way, though, and I couldn’t be happier about it. His <a href="http://troutworks.com/Timlog/timlog.php?y=2001&amp;m=5&amp;d=8">You still working on that?</a> blogpost gave me my first inklings on how difficult, and how interesting, web search could be:</p>
