I asked the following question on the Linguist List:
 Words like ‘to dial’ and ‘key’ and ‘album’ take on a shifted meaning as the underlying technology changes. Wordnet, for example, still defines ‘to dial’ as something like ‘to enter a telephone number using a dial.’ Of course, most dialing now occurs via push-buttons. Similarly, keys are now often made of a plastic card (or are completely virtual), and an ‘album’ can be a CD.">

<p>I asked the following question on the Linguist List:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Words like ‘to dial’ and ‘key’ and ‘album’ take on a shifted meaning as the underlying technology changes. Wordnet, for example, still defines ‘to dial’ as something like ‘to enter a telephone number using a dial.’ Of course, most dialing now occurs via push-buttons. Similarly, keys are now often made of a plastic card (or are completely virtual), and an ‘album’ can be a CD. Is there a term of art for this kind of semantic shift?
Robin Barr responded with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve seen the term ‘subreption’ used for this type of change. The classic examples are ‘pen’ and ‘book’ — the items themselves have undergone cultural or technological changes, but the core meaning is still the same. I suppose you could also call this a special case of metaphorical transfer: the referent changes but the function or use stays the same.
<em>Subreption</em> is also used in Catholic canon law to mean the act of omitting evidence that should be presented, and thus <em>surreptitiously</em> making a case. It’s also used in <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-metaphysics/#2.2">Kant’s discussion</a> of logical fallacies pertaining to metaphysics.</p>
