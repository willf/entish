Tom Fox, one of the Christian Peacemaker Team kidnapped in Iraq over 100 days ago, is dead. The other three members of the CPT team were shown alive in a video on February 28.</p>
<p>Tom Fox was, by all accounts, a brave man willing to risk his life in order “to take part in the creation of the Peaceable Realm of God,” <a href="http://electroniciraq.net/news/2212.shtml">as he wrote</a> before leaving for Iraq. He also wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why are we here?” We are here to root out all aspects of dehumanization that exists within us. We are here to stand with those being dehumanized by oppressors and stand firm against that dehumanization. We are here to stop people, including ourselves, from dehumanizing any of God’s children, no matter how much they dehumanize their own souls.
This deeply saddens me; our prayers are with Tom Fox’s family, the remaining hostages and their captors.</p>
