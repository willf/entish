    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Bess and I played Scrabble (er, make that Scrabble ™ brand crossword game) tonight, but we didn’t have a dictionary so we had to use our ‘internal’ ones. I passed on a bingo, because I wasn’t quite sure whether ‘li’ was a word (I thought it was, but wasn’t confident enough to force the issue). It is a word, and I even remembered the meaning correctly: a Chinese unit of distance. ‘Ka’ was another word–I wouldn’t have played it, but Bess said to go ahead (it was my last letter). It, too, is a word–an ancient Eqyptian religious term.</p>
<p>But what gets me is that the official Scrabble dictionary (at least, their online version) does not have ‘sorbetto’ as a word. ‘Sorbet’ is fine; so is ‘sherbet,’ of course. It was my first play, and I got a bingo on it; Bess challenged it, but I stood my ground. If we’d had the dictionary, I would have lost the turn. But really, if ‘sorbet’ is an acceptable word, shouldn’t ‘sorbetto’ be as well?</p>
<p>(According to Wikipedia, all these words come from–wait for it–the Turkish word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbet">sherbat</a>.</p>
<p>‘Sherbat,’ of course, isn’t in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, either.</p>
