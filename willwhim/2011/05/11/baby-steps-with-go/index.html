    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I’ve started teaching myself the <a href="http://golang.org">Go programming language</a>. I’m enjoying most aspects of it. It feels like a really modern C–that is, low level enough to be fast, but with lots of the bells and whistles one comes to expect in a modern programming language. It has lots of data types, an interesting alternative to object-oriented programming called interfaces, a reasonably-sized library, support for concurrency baked into the language, etc. The Go home page says it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It’s a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
It has a kind of persnickety feel to it that I kind of like. It practically insists on formatting code in certain style–a style that I used to use,  but from which I have weaned myself away because I became convinced that a different way was better. In doing so, you can dispense with some programming punctuation, and it ends up having a bit of a flavor of Python or Ruby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been working a bit on a library for bit sets–there isn’t one in the core library–and have found the community quite helpful. This, of course, is a good sign for a language. The code I’ve been working on, with lots of kibitzing from the veteran Go language people, can be found at <a href="https://github.com/willf/bitset"><a href="https://github.com/willf/bitset">https://github.com/willf/bitset</a></a>. One thing I like is that, in addition to the core language information, the Go website includes an essay on <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">writing Go effectively</a>, and how to write code that might be considered for inclusion in the standard libraries. It even has a standard unit testing library.</p>
