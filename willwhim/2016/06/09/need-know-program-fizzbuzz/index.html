<p>This got me to thinking about what you actually need to know about a particular programming language and software engineering to program FizzBuzz in.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic implementation in Go:</p>

<p>So I think these are the things you need to know (including the syntax of these in a particular language):</p>
<ul>
<li>How to write a main function</li>
<li>The mod function and how to use it</li>
<li>How to print something</li>
<li>How to write a for loop</li>
<li>How to write a select statement (or if/then/else cascade)</li>
