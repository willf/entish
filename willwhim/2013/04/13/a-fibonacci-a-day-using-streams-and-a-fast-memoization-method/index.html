<p>A <em>stream</em> is a standard Scala data structure which is very list like. Recall that a Scala list has two parts, a head and a tail; the head is a value, and the tail is either the special empty list (Nil), or another list. For example, the list created by List(“cat”, “mouse”, “cheese”) is a list whose head is “cat”, and whose tail is a list whose head is “mouse” and whose tail is a list whose head is “cheese” and whose tail is Nil (the cheese does not quite stand alone).</p>
<p>Elements in a stream (the values in their heads), on the other hand, are only evaluated when they are needed. For example, getting the _n_th value is a stream causes the steam to evaluate its first element, its second element, etc, up to <em>n</em>. Once evaluated, they are remembered (that is, memoized) so they the next time the element is requested, the value has already been computed (the lookup is still O(n), but no computation is done).</p>
<p>Here’s a definition of a fibonacci stream, pretty much as given in the documents</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This defines an “infinite” list of fibonacci numbers — infinite in the sense that the list can be as long as we have memory for. Note that Scala allows us to have <em>recursive data structures</em> as well as recursive functions. Here the tail of the _fibs stream (after the 2nd element, anyway) is defined in turns of itself — we zip the stream with the tail of the stream, and then each element is the sum of the two previous elements — just as we had defined.</p>
<p>We can access this list in a similar way to our previous functions to get positive and negative fibonacci numbers:</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>How does compare in speed with our previous functions? Calling stream_fibonacci(1000) the first time results in zipping though the stream and calculating the sums. Somewhat surprisingly, this is not more expensive than our fastest version. Afterwards, though, we just “look up” the 1001st element, which requires traversing the stream’s first 1001 elements. But this is very fast, and is about 100x times faster on my machine (see <a href="http://willwhim.wpengine.com/2013/03/20/a-fibonacci-a-day-benchmarking/" title="A Fibonacci A Day — Benchmarking">the updated benchmarks</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, this comes at the expense of memory storage for the 1001 fibonacci numbers in the stream. Depending on the application, this could be just fine. Of course, fibonacci numbers get big fast, so maintaining a large stream of them might not be good (the other versions only require two or so BigInts to be held in memory during the computation).</p>
