      I was born William Alan Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald, of course is my family name, but I don’t have any real connections to ‘William’ or ‘Alan.’ My dad sometimes says I was named after my Uncle Allen, but if so, why isn’t my middle name spelled as he spells it? It doesn’t make sense.
So, as of now, I am changing my name.
I want a name that’s different. Really different. Different all the time.

      This past weekend, Bess, Jane and I attended the 50th anniversary of the founding of Reba Place Church, the church we attended in the 90’s when I was in graduate school and for a few years afterwards. Saturday was spent going though a decade by decade retrospective. Reba began as, essentially, a commune in the 50’s and experienced explosive growth through the 60s and 70s. They allowed non-communal members in the 80s and there were many aftershocks of many of the communal members becoming everyday variety congregational members.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      There’s a great interview by Sian Liu with Steve Newcomb, Powerset’s COO (and ultimately my boss). He describes life and work at Powerset, some of the risks, the culture of openness at Powerset, and why we don’t see Google as the enemy. Granted, it’s not a hard-hitting interview (Liu even says “I am looking forward to … exploring long-term career opportunties in Powerset,” which blunts one’s objectivity), but it gives a good picture of what Powerset is like.

      II can’t do justice to the vacation time we were privileged to have last week, but I wanted to write down a few things, even if it’s just for our own memories in the future.
The basic goal: go to Camp Fasola, a singing camp put on by the Sacred Harp Music Association, now in its fifth year. Dear wife Bess suggested we go, and so she, I, and our daughter Jane, along with two of Jane’s friends (Rachel and Emma) headed down to Alabama.

      This is nice: in addition to automated translation, Google has now added translation dictionaries, for English to Spanish, French, Italian, German and Korean, and back again.They seem a bit dated: no translations for “weblog” or “telecommute” or even “google.” But it does have “computer virus.”
