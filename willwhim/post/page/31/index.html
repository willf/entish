      After a week or so of unseasonably warm weather, we woke up to heavy, sleeting rain and promises of up to a foot of snow. School is called off, and probably most work sites are closed (but not for us telecommuters).
It must be hard to live in temperate climes where you can’t experience the joy of a snow day; or, as we say here in Michigan, Snow Day!!!!!!! My brother, the UPS driver, would probably use a different set of punctuation.

      Gulp.
David Smith at The Guardian hypes web 2.0 (or web 3.0) and writes “The new Google is … Powerset.”
Calm down, everyone. Read what Barney Pell (Powerset CEO), Lorenzo Thione (Product Architect) and Steve Newcomb (COO) are saying on their blogs, especially Barney’s comments on Google and Powerset in the Sunday Times:
 Search is in its early days, and natural language is the future of search. But it’s both difficult to enable natural language search at all, and to do it on a scale like Google is a harder matter still.

      Cool, the news is officially out: Powerset has raised $12.5 M in series A financing (our press release). Bambi Francisco wrote a story for MarketWatch, and did an interview with our CEO, Barney Pell. Great lead to Francisco’s story:
 So they must be crazy, have a high threshold for pain, or are certain to deliver a brilliant product, right? Update: And it feels even more real when it makes the New York Times (a Times blog, but still).

      Our company did a slight remake of our website, with perhaps the most interesting thing: a list of our Angel round investors mentioned on our newly minted company blog.
What’s that you say, a company can’t have a blog? That there’s no difference between a company blog and a press release? Silly you: Press releases talk about the company in the third person, have an about section, and a media contact.

      I’ve just finished Mark Helprin’s picaresque novel Freddy and Fredericka. It’s a good book that could have been a great book–or, perhaps, a pretty good book that could have been a good book–with better editing. It’s conceit is wonderfully ludicrous: Freddy and Fredericka, the Prince and Princess of Wales, (based on Charles and Diana) are set the quest to reacquire the United States for the British Empire. They are parachuted into New Jersey under cover of darkness and face a number of American perils and adventures: fighting off a biker gang, traveling down Twain’s Mississippi, burgling modern art from the nouveau riche, tramping on freight trains.

      Sarah Vowell spoke at the Dowagiac Dogwood Fine Arts Festival tonight. She read from her books for about half the time, and took questions the other half–about 45 minutes each. I enjoyed her most when she was slightly off script while reading–making side comments of various sorts about the topic at hand. I’d just finished reading Assassination Vacation on the plane back from vacation (her generally delightful book about the assassinations of Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley as well as their assassinators).
