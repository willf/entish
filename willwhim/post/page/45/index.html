      Toyota received a lot of publicity (for example) for their ‘bilingual’ Camry advertisement: a father explains to his son that he bought a hybrid car for the same reason he learned English, ‘for your future.’ But it’s not very bilingual–just one phrase (‘mira, mira aquí’). In fact, the script sounds more like an ad for English assimilation–the son doesn’t seem to speak much Spanish; ¿y porqué habla el papá el inglés con su hijo dentro el espacio privado de un coche unless this is the goal?

      Interesting read from cousin-in-law Tim Oren: The War and Technology Discontinuity.
 You can see other pieces of the future [in addition to audio search and automatic translation] emerging as well. In-Q-Tel has a variety of investments in sensor related technology, including network architectures, next generation protein and gene chips, and fundamental nanotechnology fabrication techniques, with wide applicability to chemical and biological threats.

      Harper Lee, Gregarious for a Day (New York Times, requires registration). Nice to see a recent picture of her, and that a biography is due soon.
 With more than 10,000,000 copies sold since it first appeared in 1960, “To Kill a Mockingbird” exists as one of the best-selling novels of all time. For decades, Ms. Lee has remained fiercely mindful of her privacy, politely but resolutely refusing to talk to the press and making only rare public appearances, in which she always declines to speak.

      I got a comment from John Lamb about the New Year’s Harmonia Sacra singing. I quote him here:
 Six lessons from the this singing are available for listening at the following link http://www.pilgrimproduction.org/sacredharp/john%20lamb/elkhart.html Enjoy! A cd of the singing is currently in progress – it will contain roughly 26 lessons from the 60 something that were sung at the singing – including New Monmouth, which is one of my favorite songs from this singing.

        Mission Planner Interface

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      As part of the Autonomous Rotorcraft Project, I was the main developer on the Mission Planner Interface (MPI). It’s a browser-based tool (requiring Firefox 1.5, Safari, or the latest Opera beta) that allows definition of observation targets that are sent off to the mission planner, which then creates a plan to visit all of the targets and then controls the heliocopter as it carries out the mission. One cool technical trick is that the MPI uses the new-fangled ‘Ajax’ ideas to talk to the plan execution system (well, talks to a server that talks to the system) so that, for example, the position of the helicopter is shown on the map, and to provide pan-and-zoom features (a la Google Maps).

      We demo’d the Autonomous Rotocraft Project at Moffett Field today–not just any demo, but the “5 year demo,” the capstone of the project. I was a bit nervous, since I had a major role to play in the demo script, but hadn’t actually been able to practice with the real helicopter. There was a tricky bit where I had to induce a simulated ‘communication fault,’ so the helicopter could respond in a useful way–but it had to be done at just the right time; that is, where a communication fault could occur and be successfully taken care of.

      New human virus linked to obesity in animals:
 “The nearly simultaneous increase in the prevalence of obesity in most countries of the world is difficult to explain by changes in food intake and exercise alone, and suggests that adenoviruses could have contributed,” the authors state.“The role of adenoviruses in the worldwide epidemic of obesity is a critical question that demands additional research.”

      David W. Music of Baylor led a Sacred Harp workshop at the Calvin Symposium on Worship at Calvin College today. A good number of people where there– a hundred or more, including very large alto and treble sections. They were good, experienced singers who, for the most part, were unfamiliar with Sacred Harp singing.
David did a masterful job of leading people through the shapes and eleven tunes. He started with Martin, a good choice for new Sacred Harp singers struggling with the shapes because there is a lot of repitition and it’s ususally sung slowly.

      We have a big demo next week that requires at least one rain-free morning on Tuesday or Wednesday, so I’ve been checking the weather forecasts. One thing I’ve learned is that the National Weather Service publishes ‘forecast discussions.’ These give the rationale for the government’s weather forecasts. For example, from today:
 After Sunday…the forecast becomes much less clear. Over the past several days…there has been significant variation in solutions both run-to-run of the same model and between the different longer-range models.
