      My life is pretty easy if this is the biggest complaint I feel the need to write about:
 We purchased a Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach Easyglide Pro Freshmint Floss, and have had the following problems: – there is so much wax on the floss, it is hard to use because it slips in our hands, – there is so much wax on the floss, it is hard to get between our teeth, – it is almost impossible to cut the floss using the included cutter, – the cutter and feeder are poorly attached to the body, and so collapsed when trying to cut the floss, – the idea of having a ‘pro’ floss stikes us as silly as best and insulting at worst, – we resent having to pay extra for non-functioning products (often, we are unable to purchase J&amp;J’s basic waxed floss because stores do not carry it).

      It was good–make that great–to be singing at home. It’s hard to believe that it was just a year ago that I led my first tune at a Kalamazoo singing. It was wonderful to sing with Bess and Idy Kiser in the morning and then between David Ivey and Judy Hauff in the afternoon. It was very hot and humid again, and we actually finished a bit early as a result, after everyone had a chance to lead.

      It was a very good singing today in Goshen; as Mark Miller has remarked, it’s a bit like singing inside the body of a guitar. Lots of southern singers, a very fierce alto section, excellent food. It was stifling hot–in the high 90’s, I think, and humid–but somehow that was all right. Sam Sommers: we’re going to take a break now, and be sure to try and rehydrate yourselves, and if you can’t do that, at least drink some water.

      A definition from the electronic dictionary program that comes with the Macintosh (based the New Oxford American English Dictionary):
 faith-based (adjective): affiliated with or based on religion or a religious group : a faith-based plan that bilked investors out of millions. USAGE The preponderance of usage for this term today connects it with institutions and programs that are affiliated with an organized religion, and with President George W. Bush’s faith-based initiative, which enables religious institutions doing social work to receive government funding.

 Hello everyone … especially my fine friends to the coastal south! 39 I’ll be traveling through California over the next couple of weeks, and I wonder if anyone out there would like to meet me for some random singing. I have very little flexibility, due to the nature of my trip, so here are the dates I will be in each city, and some indication of the times I might be available as well.

      The always interesting Jean Veronis posts about page duplicates in English and French.
He investigates how many pages are returned for a search for the new word “ségolisme” (for which he can control at bit for precision numbers), and how many of these are duplicates due to RSS feeds, etc. A money quote:
 So, what are all these pages that Google considers to be similar? On closer inspection we can see that they are mainly RSS versions of the same page, archived pages (a blog often presents the same post in an individual version and also in a weekly or monthly archive), versions of posts both with and without comments, and links such as “trackback” or “new comments”, which are also commonplace on blogs.
