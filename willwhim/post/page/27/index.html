      Why are you reading this, when you should be reading Natalia’s ball-peen hammer to the head?
One of the many things that it takes for a computer to “understand” text (as we are trying to do at Powerset) is for it recognize names and what they refer to. So for example, in the sentence “Maid Marian is the female companion to the legendary figure Robin Hood.”, a computer needs to see the names Maid Marian and Robin Hood are present, and have some kind of internal representation of Ms.

The chart above are the results from the Protein-Protein Interaction Task.
My colleague at Powerset, Jim Firby and I worked on some of the semantic parsing technology used by the Colorado group.

      This has been a delightful weekend. On Saturday, I attended the Golden Gate Sacred Harp singing in San Francisco (with a nice Après-chant at Philip’s house, nicely described by Linda, who also has pictures of the singing). In the morning today, Jeff Shrager took me to see redwoods and banana slugs and tidepools, capped by some nice bluegrass music at a cafe. Worship at Sojourners was also good.
Back in Michigan, I missed some cool things happening.

      Last night, we went to a Good Friday service which included a meal, and I sat down next to my very Republican friend, Butch, who never has anything good to say about government (despite, or perhaps because of, having been a government social services employee for years). We don’t usually talk politics–the gap between us is too large and our friendship too fragile for this–but he started complaining about recent proposals to raise taxes to fix Michigan roads.

      Mark writes about serving pancakes for supper for the first time (and claims to be the first evah to blog about it).
And it reminded me how much I like Alaga syrup, “The official syrup and hot sauce of the Montgomery Biscuits.” I have no idea when I first started using (back in Carbondale, Illinois?), but it’s what I prefer for all my syrup needs. Imagine my delight that you can buy Alaga by by the case, only $30 for 12 24-ounce bottles (plus shipping).

      An interesting idea: Ficlets. Anyone can write a 1k story portion (a “fictlet”); anyone can write prequels and sequels to any ficlet. All under a Creative Commons 2.5 license.
Is this a “bite size medium,” or will a chains of ficlets (or the entire space of probabilities for a ficlet chain) become a “full meal medium?”
Somewhere in academia, a PhD thesis is waiting to be born.
