      I was wondering whether Scala had a parallel map function built in — it didn’t seem like it did.
Edit: But it does; see Erik Post’s comment below.
But, if you have a sequence of functions, for example:
val fns = List(() =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;, () =&gt; &quot;goodbye&quot;, () =&gt; &quot;good to see you&quot;)
You can create a sequence of futures on it (thus, running them in parallel): import scala.actors.Futures._ val futures = fns.

      Yesterday, I was writing some code that needed to (1) go over a collection of stored database objects, conditionally convert some of these to another version of themselves, and filter out some of them. For some reason, I got myself tripped up on some very basic things, and so here are some notes for myself and perhaps for others. (There were some other things going on, for one, support website pagination, but I won’t discuss that here).

Patrick of Ireland
Once upon a time — and listen, for although this sounds like a fable, I will try to make every word true — once upon a time there was a young boy named Patrick, a young Christian boy whose father was a deacon, and whose grandfather was a priest.

      The tr program converts a string of characters into another string of characters, using a very simple rule system. The tr [A-Z] [a-z]. But this works for simple “ASCII” strings only. tr, at least on many systems, understands Unicode, and so the standard example fails for converting, say, Russian or Czech. But tr also understands character classes, so the standard example should be written tr [:upper:] [:lower:].

      This American Life released a retraction today about it story reporting on working conditions at Apple suppliers in China. Kudos to This American Life for spending an entire show on this.
I’m afraid that This American Life’s focus on its own errors might overshadow the truths about working conditions in China. To their credit, they spend some time trying to get at the facts.
In the final minutes, Ira Glass interviews Charles Duhigg of the New York Times, who has done his own investigation of working conditions at Apple.

      A random Scala note.
Today, I wanted to apply a list of filters to each item in a list, and return just those that pass each of the filters.
For example, given a range of integers, return just those that are divisible by 2 and by 3.
Let’s start by defining a boolean function divides:
Note that divides(2,_:Int) defines the (partial) function for division by 2.
So we can create our filters so:

      Last night, I watched the American Experience documentary on the Amish, which I thought very well done. They treated the Amish with respect, neither nostalgically nor scornfully, with beautiful camera work, well-crafted stories, and good expert commentary. Personally, I especially enjoyed hearing some Amish singing, especially O Gott Vater, which I have never heard sung.
They told the story of the 2006 Nickel Mines tragedy, in which a man shot ten Amish girls in a schoolhouse, killing five of them, and of the amazing forgiveness the Amish showed the killer (who died in the attack) and the killer’s family.

      Dearest creature in creation, Study English pronunciation. It’s more regular in its core Than pundits, who focus on its more Erratic ways, would have you believe. Perhaps they simply cannot conceive Of any system not based in Latin— They would choose, I suppose, to flatten All writing to “one form, one sound” But, really, regularities abound.
