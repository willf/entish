      I voted in Kalamazoo, Michigan; our district uses optical scanners. I arrived around 7:30 am. I vote at the school my daughter attends, and I walked her down. The line was quite long — it was cool and a bit drizzly, but I didn’t sense that people were leaving. I got out at 8:40. I noticed that I was the 101st voter; the previous voter was right ahead of me. So, with the polls opening at 7:00, this means they were handling about 1 voter per minute.

Strong defense and security, a commitment to protecting America, to protecting or families–Our President, our Commander in Chief George W. Bush is the strong and steady leader we need. Without your vote, he’ll be forced to step down and surrender his position to an upredictable and risky candidate with a completely different set of priorities for America.

      Geoff Pullum has a great anti-Struck and White rant, which he says is:
 a horrid little compendium of unmotivated prejudices (don’t use ongoing), arbitrary stipulations (don’t begin a sentence with however), and fatuous advice (“Be clear”), ridiculously out of date in its positions on appropriate choices among grammatical variants, deeply suspect in its style advice and grotesquely wrong in most of the grammatical advice it gives.
Struck and White was (I think) the first book on writing style I ever read, and I fell in love–mostly, I think, because of White’s introductory essay.

      [The senior Whitehouse aide] told me something that at the time I didn’t fully comprehend — but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.
The aide said that guys like me were ”in what we call the reality-based community,” which he defined as people who ”believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.” I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism.

      Tim Bray recommends:
 If you’re running a company and there’s a general perception that your CEO is [an expletive for fool], eventually it won’t matter that much whether he really is or isn’t; the perception will become an obstacle. And right now, the United States of America is facing that obstacle.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      People always want “knock-out blows” in a debate, but there weren’t any, of course. Bush usually sounded less desparate than he did in the first two debates; he always seems more intelligent when he’s calm. Kerry’s performance was exactly the same as in the first two debates: “presidential,” in a word. CBS’s instant poll of undecideds said a plurality thought Kerry had won the debate.
I could be wrong, but I think this debate shows that the right’s use of “liberal” as a scare word is dying.
