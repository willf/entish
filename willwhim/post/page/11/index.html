      I noticed that the expression “avoid like the plaque” showing up in some search results I was doing. This is “plaque” with-a-queue, not “plague”-with-a-gee. This seems like an odd misspelling to me, and I was curious how often this occurs. The Bing Ngram data gives us the tools: given “avoid like the”, the word “plague” occurs 98.68% of the time (in the web body data). The word “plaque” is the second most common word, occurring 0.

      I was writing some instrumentation code in C# today that looked like this:
MeasureOn(&quot;SomeFeature&quot;); ComputeSomeFeature(); MeasureOff(&quot;SomeFeature&quot;); MeasureOn(&quot;AnotherFeature&quot;); ComputeAnotherFeature(); MeasureOff(&quot;AnotherFeature&quot;);
If I were using a language with (compile-time) code macros (like Clojure, Scheme or Lisp), I’d prefer to write something like:
Measuring(&quot;SomeFeature&quot;){ComputeSomeFeature();} Measuring(&quot;AnotherFeature&quot;){ComputeAnotherFeature();}
But C# doesn’t have such a basic and useful thing, by design (bad design, I think, but still by design).
But C# does have first-class anonymous functions, so it’s possible to write methods that take one of these as a parameter.

      I’ve updated the Microsoft NGram Ruby library to provide an example use: segmenting Twitter hashtags. Twitter hashtags have been used for some time to tag tweets according to users’ choice and whimsy. Coincidentally, my daytime boss has just conducted an interview with William Morgan–formerly of Powerset, but now at Twitter–about hash tags, in case you want to come up to speed on what they are. It’s a fun read in any case, including the origin story of hash tags.

      First mention in the New York Times of the expression “sanctity of marriage.”
 We cannot be silent on those laws of your country which, in direct contravention of God’s own law, ‘instituted in the time of man’s innocency,’ deny, in effect, to the slave the sanctity of marriage, with all its joys, rights and obligations. New York Times, December 15, 1852, Page 1.
 This is contra a claim in “Traditional Marriage Perverts the Tradition of Marriage,” that the phrase was invented in 2004.

      I’ve been playing with Microsoft Research’s ngram server in my spare time. I’ll write some more about this in time, I hope.
The API returns base 10 logs for its probabilities. Because the probabilities returned are so very low, it makes more sense to return a log probability. I could be wrong, but I think it’s normal practice to return base 2 logs, or base e logs for log probabilities. They are easily to convert from one base to another, so it doesn’t really matter.

It seems ridiculous that there would be any issue here at all.

      I just noticed that Richard Stoddard posted a recording of my leading Few Happy Matches at Camp Fasola in 2009 (the recording was done by Al McCready). This is a tune I had been leading a lot at Sacred Harp singings and conventions in 2009; I still like it. One silly reason is that the tune’s title indicates a goal of a good search engine. The title actually comes from an Isaac Watts poem about the difficulty of good marriage matches, according to Warren Steele.

      In one of the “Mad Men” discussions, someone asks if it was anachronistic to describe Freddy Rumsen as “clean and sober” in 1963 (from here, I think.)
The first clear use of this expression in the New York Times archives is from August 28, 1892, which has the embedded note in an article about a murder trial:

      I enjoyed reading the Wikipedia page about its “lamest edit wars.” One of these edit wars was whether the article on what Americans call “aluminum” and what Brits call “aluminium” should have, as its fundamental title, “Aluminum,” or “Aluminium.” And, one of the arguments presented in favo(u)r of “Aluminum” was that more Google hits are available for the US spelling than the UK spelling. “Ghits” is notoriously unreliable (as are Bing hits and the other search engines), since the number of search results reported are subject to lots of factors, not of which is tied directly to actual number of documents returned.
