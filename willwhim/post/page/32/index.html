      Bess and I made a quickie visit “up north” to see two of my brothers and their families. Here are a few pictures from our visit to Ed’s house.
Ed just bought a pretty cool chipper–he does a lot of part time work cutting down trees, and chipping them.
Even cooler, Ed bought an old firetruck from the Baldwin fire department. He hopes to put a pick on it to get up higher in the trees.

      Fred Clark has a provocative article, Dirty work, that makes an interesting point about people who do the ‘dirty work’ of torture, such as our American agents who engage in tortuous activities such as waterboarding. First, he notes that these people, at the end of the day, must enjoy their work, and thus are worthy of being called sadists, sociopaths, sexual perverts or worse. (This reminds me of Miss Hardcastle in Lewis’s That Hideous Strength).

      ITunes 7.0.x for the Mac, at least, is very, very buggy. Here are instructions for reverting to iTunes 6.0.5, based on instructions found in various places on the web. ITunes 7.0.x hasn’t worked for me at all for more than 10 minutes since I installed it. The 7.0.1 release did not fix any of the problems that I was having. Note that these instructions will lose any changes you’ve made since upgrading to iTunes 7.

      An article in Ventureblog about Powerset, the company I work for, has kicked up a minor storm in the blogosphere about Powerset and the very idea of natural language search. I’d just like to point people to a weblog post by Barney Pell, our CEO, on Powerset and Natural Language Search. For those who might wonder why I’m working for Powerset, Barney’s vision explains it well:
 Seen in this light, there is enormous room for fundamental innovation in search, as the game has only just begun.

      It’s looking as if Neil Armstrong did say “One small step for a man…” rather than “One small step for man…”; this is what he has always maintained as his intent (Houston Chronicle story; via /.).
Perhaps someday historians will correct it again to “That’s one small step for a man; one giant leap for humanity.”
Update: I should have been a bit more skeptical, I think. At least taken a closer look at the data, which David Beaver has now done in a post on Language Log.

      For Jane’s science class, we performed a science experiment at home (She is studying the scientific method again). Because Bess works with peppers, we designed a simple experiment to see which part of an Anaheim pepper is the hottest: the seeds, the flesh, the placenta or the stem. Bess carefully cut a small piece of the flesh and the placenta (she put the stem aside) about the size of a seed for each of us.
