      A note I wrote to the Fasola discussion list, on whether ‘midst’ is archaic or not
Although my mama warned me never to discuss language usage in public forums, let me weigh in here a bit …
Here is the line from “On the swiftness of Time” posted by Jesse Pearlman Karlsberg:
Unthinking man! remember this, Thou, 'midst thy sublunary bliss, Must groan, and gasp, and die!  I think what is ‘archaic’ (that is, no longer in common use) about the use of midst here is its use as a preposition.

      Last night, i attended the annual Gymanfa Ganu (/gI’manfa ‘ganI/ at Salem Presbyterian Church in Venedocia, Ohio with good friend Samuel Sommers. A gymanfa is a Welsh hymn sing; Sam is a fellow Sacred Harp singer with relatives at Salem, and it was great fun talking with him to and from Venedocia. The singing itself was interestingly different from Sacred Harp singing. We sat in parts, but we had a director (Trevor Williams) who would instruct us and even stop us if he wanted to correct or encourage certain things.

      Here’s something very Sacred Harp: The Parting Hand, a site to record songs you’d like sung and other remembrances made at your own funeral. It’s a quick site Annie Grieshop and I put together over the past few days in our spare time.
“The Parting Hand” is the tune most frequently sung at the end of a Sacred Harp convention.
My Christian friends, in bonds of love, Whose hearts in sweetest union join, Your friendship’s like a drawing band, Yet we must take the parting hand.

      150 years ago (on August 27, 1856), Abraham Lincoln made his only visit to Michigan; he spoke in Kalamazoo’s downtown park as part of a rally for John C. Fremont, the first Republican nominee for President. There are a number of events taking place in Kalamazoo this weekend, sponsored, in part, by our local state senator (a Republican, natch, and against whom my brother-in-law Sandy Lipsey is running this fall).

      With the demotion of Pluto to a dwarf planet, there are reports that a new mnemonic is required to recall the order of the nine–er, wait, only eight–planets. In fact, Jason Kottke sponsored a mnemonics contest. Kottke is one of the first generation bloggers, along Meg Hourihan. They were the subject of a New Yorker article early on, as well as an update recently when they got married. Kottke doesn’t write very much about himself, though, so I was pretty sure my entry wouldn’t win, but I still like it very much:

      Rachel Miller Jacobs, of Kern Street Mennonite Church in South Bend, Indiana, was ordained yesterday. Rachel is one of the Goshen, Indiana Sacred Harp singers, and it was with great pleasure that some of us were able to sing as a prelude to her ordination service, which was marked by good prayers, lovely singing, an excellent call to ministry by one of her seminary professors, and much obvious love for Rachel by the congregration she serves as the minister of spiritual formation, and by Rachel for the people she serves and from whom she has learned.
