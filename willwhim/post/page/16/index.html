      It’s been too long since my last update, but life has been busy, especially with the Microsoft purchase. But a few notes:
 I enjoyed singing Sacred Harp at the Michiana and Kalamazoo annual singings this weekend, and James Nelson-Gingerich gave me the *first* copy of the print version of 26th edition of the Harmonia Sacra for my work on the Harmonia Sacra website. I’m looking forward to a family reunion of all my brothers (five of us!

      (The usual disclaimers: my opinion only, not my current or future employers)
When Powerset began a couple of years ago, a lot of commentators called us — and still do call us — a would be Google killer. This, despite repeated comments by senior staff that this wasn’t what we were about. As a company, Google is hard to beat. Our goal was audacious, but not that audacious. Our goal was to build a better search experience: to use natural language technology to provide better search results, both by having a better understanding of web documents as well as user queries.

      This might not be worth a post, but anyway:
Arnold Zwicky has a post at Language Log on “home” vs. “house” in (American) English, citing (among other things) the commentators in the Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage saying:
 A final note on home ownership: MWDEU reports that “a number of commentators have remarked on the tendency to buy a home and sell a house”. I was curious to see whether this ‘tendency’ was real, so I checked the Google 3-gram data (see announcement).

Seven factz about me:
 Will Fitzgerald didn’t use a computer until he was 23. It had cards. It is difficult for Will Fitzgerald to refer to himself in the third person. Despite his descriptivist linguistic training, Will Fitzgerald tries to distinguish ‘between’ and ‘among’. Will Fitzgerald was known as “Bill” until he was 33. Will Fitzgerald has half of a house named in his honor.

      It’s all (well, mostly) about representation. Peter Turney:
 [F]iguring out how to represent the problem is 95% of the work. By the time you have the representation right, the tool that you use to finish the remaining 5% is not terribly important.

      Over at FiveThirtyEight, the following ‘homework assignment’ was given:
 How many unique ways are there to acquire at least 270 electoral votes without any excess? I figured it would be a ‘large’ number, but I was surprised at the actual total: 51,199,463,116,367 (or, fifty-one trillion and change). about 2.3% of all possible combinations (This exact number is based on the simplifying assumption of treating Maine and Nevada as giving up their electoral votes in the same way as all the other states).
