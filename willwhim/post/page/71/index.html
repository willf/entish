      Man o’ man is this cool: interactive chart of name popularity.. The chart here shows the popularity of names starting with LAT; it was interesting to see the decrease in people named ‘Jane,’ (our daughter’s name) over time–it really does seem like an ‘old lady’s name,’ as Jane often complains. No Britneys before the 1970s, or Khalils before the 1980s. (The chart only has data for the 1000 most popular names per decade).

      Yet Another Cell Phone Distraction Study. Study size: 20. Findings: talking on a cell phone is distracting; young people react with the slowness of older/drunken people; old people react with the slowness of slightly older people. Six of the 20 rear-ended the (simulated) pace car (four while talking on a cell phone).
 “If you put a 20-year-old driver behind the wheel with a cell phone, their reaction times are the same as a 70-year-old driver who is not using a cell phone.

      A good Globe ad Mail report on what they claim is the “first-ever full-fledged scholarly conference on Canadian English”, the Canadian English in a Global Context conference, which took place this past weekend. Going to the conference site leads to this link for Canadian English studies. The CBC did a show on Talking Canadian when I lived there, but I missed it, unfortunately.

      Daughter Jane is taking the SAT test next week as part of a program to foster academically talented junior high students. We’re fairly confident of her language skills (today she asked me what ‘subcutaneous meant), but she’s fairly math adverse, so Bess asked me to tutor her a little. It’s hard to know how to prepare a 12 year old for the math section of the SATs, but today we spent about an hour discussing odds and percentages.

      I came across a You know you’re from Michigan when… list, and it had the following item:
 When giving directions, you refer to “A Michigan Left.”Hmm, I’ve never heard of this, but searching the web I found this: The Michigan Left-Hand Turn, complete with diagrams. Fortunately, we don’t have any of these in Kalamazoo, although they’re a bane whenever I drive Gratiot Avenue when I visit my father near Detroit.

      From: Do You Speak American / Sea to Shining Sea / American Varieties / Midwest:
 Indeed, it is not uncommon to find Michiganders who will claim that the speech of national broadcasters is modeled on their dialect. Even a cursory comparison of the speech of the network news anchors with that of the local news anchors in Detroit will reveal the fallacy of such claims.and
  As long as Midwesterners are viewed as average, boring or otherwise nondescript, their speech will be seen through the same prism.

Mark was off to a ‘black-tie’ party of this own (having found a spiffy tuxedo for $20 dollars–shades of Napoleon Dynamite–at a thrift store).

      From the New York Times review of ‘The Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker’ by Walter Kern:
 [O]ne does sense that the cartoons have done the job they first set out to do: purging any lingering puritanism from their relatively well-heeled audience and replacing it with a smart-aleck self-awareness that suddenly — just look around — feels useless, lonely and crippling.
 I just received this book as a Christmas present.
