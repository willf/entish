      Excellent teaching by Debbie Gish at Church of the Sojourners in San Francisco, Reading the Revelation at Lent. Excerpt:
 Like it or not, which often I don’t, we are actually in a battle, in a war. Being strong, being focused, being whole hearted and single-minded are painfully necessary….This isn’t a war of survival; this is a war of conquering. And in order to conquer, not just survive, we gotta get the Enemies ways and means out of our system.

      How do all things with names combine? Words are but nests, the meanings are the birds, Body the bed through which the spirit-river flows. The surface of this mental watercourse Is not without its chaff of good and bad repute: It flows, but you would say it stagnates; It moves but you would say it stays; From place to place were there no motion Whence these renewed supplies of floating chaff?

      The blogosphere is abuzz with discussions about the controversy about censorship of the Newbery Medal winning children’s book “The Higher Power of Lucky,” because it contains the word ‘scrotum’ on the first page, especially after an article about the controversy appeared on the first page of The New York Times (the article in question, soon to be behind the Times’s paywall).

      Death, like an overflowing stream, Sweeps us away; our life’s a dream, An empty tale, a morning flow’r, Cut down and withered in an hour.
Our age to sev’nty years is set; How short the time! How frail the state! And if to eighty we arrive, We’d rather sigh and groan than live.
Teach us, Oh Lord, how frail is man; And kindly lengthen out the span, Till a wise care of piety Fit us to die and dwell with Thee.

      The Rev. Vernon Tyson remembers ‘Miss Amy’s witness,’ during the civil rights era in Raleigh, North Carolina.
 In 1963, when the Rev. Vernon Tyson was pastor of Jonesboro Methodist Church in Sanford, he invited Dr. Samuel Proctor to preach for what was called Race Relations Sunday. Proctor, an African-American and one of the leading theologians in the United States until his death in 1997, was then president of North Carolina A&amp;T in Greensboro.

      St. Basil, who lived from around 330-379 CE, is one of the “three hierarchs” of the Orthodox Church. I’ve just finished reading (in a translation by RJ Deferrai), an excellent essay On the distinction between ousia and hypostasis. In this letter, he writes very clearly about the Christian view of God as Triune, in particular explaining the meaning of the technical terms ousia (abstract being) and hypostasis (individual being).
It’s good as a piece of theology, but it’s also interesting as clear technical writing.
