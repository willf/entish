      I think this is the first writeup of the company I work for, Powerset, that I’ve seen: Spying an intelligent search engine. Barney Pell, our CEO, is interviewed.
 Search engines try to train us to become good keyword searchers. We dumb down our intelligence so it will be natural for the computer,” said Pell, whose company, Powerset, is based in Palo Alto, Calif. “The big shift that will happen in society is that instead of moving human expressions and interactions into what’s easy for the computer, we’ll move computers’ abilities to handle expressions that are natural for the human,” he said.

      Wonderful Chris Thorman has published a beautifully designed page showing frequency and rank statistics for tune selection from the Denson Sacred Harp conventions–for all years with on-line data (1995-2005) at Fasola.org. I’ve been playing with the data.
 The distribution of frequency to rank is an almost perfect lognormal curve for the 11 years (98% correlation). I was surprised to see that Liberty (137) has the biggest downward trend over the 11 year period — it’s ‘batting average’ dropped from .

      Way fun: The Atlantic has posted James Fallows’s essay, Living with a computer as part of their Tech &amp; Innovation “Celebration of 150 Years” tour. It was written in 1982, and describes his using an early word processor program, the Electric Pencil, running on 48k of memory (carefully described: “each K represents 1,024 bytes of information—each byte representing one character or digit—the machine can manipulate more than 49,000 items of information at a time.

      A confession: my wife bought some watermelon-flavored toothpaste for our daughter. She didn’t like it particularly, but I did. It’s a very strange translucent green, and it’s quite sweet; I suspect it’s the sweetness, not the strange color that I like.
When I was thinking about moving to San Francisco to work for the startup, I began to suspect that the toothpaste would run out about the same time as when I might come to the Bay Area.

      Apple has posted some details of the upcoming version of the Apple OS. Two little things of note that will make me want to buy it: A new speech synthesis voice, Alex, that sounds quite good. And boolean operators in Spotlight, the full-text searching tool; plus search on file attributes. The later should have already been in Spotlight, in my humble opinion, but that’s one way Apple keeps getting my money…

 Hi Will, An update on the Harmonia Sacra cd — in production as we speak. Should be in the mail by the end of the week. My apologiees for the long delay! As I’m writing this, samples from yesterday’s Hamburg, VA singing are playing in the background. A disc with 8 samples of “valley” style singing will be on their way to June Melton shortly for her Pilgrim Productions site.

      I’ve been quite enjoying reading The Barn at the End of the World, by Mary Rose O’Reilley, published by Milkweed Press. It reminds me a lot of the writing of Annie Dillard (who has her own website: ‘The Secrets of the Universe as Decoded by the Unhinged’): essays about mindfulness at the interface between the natural and artificial worlds, as well at the interface of the social and solitary life. O’Reilly has a kind of spiritual eclecticism (not only is she a Quaker Buddhist shepherd, but a former Catholic novitiate) that I find both appealing and a bit scandalous–why is this Quaker/Catholic bowing before a buddha?

      I work up so joyful this morning; it is so nice to have Bess and Jane with me here in San Francisco for a while. People at the Church of the Sojourners, and in particular the members who live in the Potrero houses where I live have been so kind: Naomi welcomed Jane and Bess with hand-made signs, and Louise made marvelous boquets for our bedrooms and a box of “movie treats” for Jane.
