      I was showing my CS professor friend the hilarious “FizzBuzz in TensorFlow” post, and he’d actually had not heard of FizzBuzz. Basically FizzBuzz is a test to see if someone can do basic programming.
This got me to thinking about what you actually need to know about a particular programming language and software engineering to program FizzBuzz in.
Here’s a basic implementation in Go:
So I think these are the things you need to know (including the syntax of these in a particular language):

      Of Truth
Francis Bacon, translated by Will Fitzgerald August 1, 2015
“What is truth?” asked jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Certainly there have been those who delight in giddiness, and count it bondage to settle on a belief, who affect free will in thinking as well as in acting. And though the schools of philosophers of that kind are gone, there remain certain chattering wits of the same vein—though not with as much blood in them as there was in the ancients.

      To partially update an Elasticsearch document in 1.6, you’ll need to create a script for the partial update, and potentially use an upsert.
For example, you want to add tags to a blog post
here’s an example of a document created directly:
POST /website/blog/1/_update { “doc” : { “tags” : [ “testing” ], “views”: 0 } }
but if we want to add a tag without changing the view, you need to create a script in config/scripts

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Word vectors have become increasingly important in as features in machine learning models for natural language processing. The idea is to represent a word in some multidimensional space (the vector) in which words which are “similar” are similar in that space. Typically, one hopes that word vectors will provide some kind of semantic similarity. A typical party trick is to use word vectors to solve word analogy problems; e.g., king is to queen as man is to ?

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      What is Named Entity Recognition? Named Entity Recognition (or NER) is the task of finding all the names of things in a text. For example, in the sentence “Jimi Hendrix played ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at Woodstock,” NER, correctly done, would find the references to “Jimi Hendrix,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and “Woodstock.” Note that NER should also extract names it has never previously seen; for example, in the sentence “Johannes von Smetly is the protagonist in Willard Smith’s new novel”, an NER system should extract “Johannes von Smetly” as a name, even if it it doesn’t appear in any standard name list.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      What is part of speech tagging? Part of speech tagging (POS tagging) is a classification problem: assigning each word or token in a text to a “part of speech,” that is, a lexical/grammatical class for each token. Different theories, or (perhaps more importantly) different uses will suggest different sets of grammatical labels, but they typically include nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. For example, the sentence “John thinks it’s all good.” might be tagged as:

      What is sentiment analysis?
Many texts contain an opinion about something: say, a movie or product review, a description of the service at a restaurant, a political position or candidate, or how things are going at a company. Sentiment analysis attempts to classify those opinions: did the writer have a positive opinion? A negative one? Or are they neutral? Sentiment analysis might also suggest how positive or negative an opinion is.
