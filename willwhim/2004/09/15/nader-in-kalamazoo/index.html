<blockquote>
<p>I talked to a dear relative of mine tonight, who’s upset that the teapot tempest concerning the possible forgery of memos concerning Bush’s military career is focusing on whether the memos were forged rather than what actually happened during these years. I personally find it interesting that the real issues of Bush’s first term of office, and which administration would be better for the US in the coming years, are not being discussed. My dear relative does like Edwards though: he seems nice and talks well.</p>
