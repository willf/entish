Its stated mission is be a “free, worldwide business directory that anyone can edit,” in the same spirit as Wikipedia. I thought it might be a good resource for company names and facts.</p>
<p>But then I noticed that the <a href="http://wikicompany.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;hideminor=1&amp;days=60&amp;limit=1500">vast majority of edits in the past sixty days</a> are about the vast conspiracy behind 9/11 and the new world order. <a href="http://wikicompany.org/wiki/index.php?title=911:Intro&amp;oldid=36595">The original 9/11 start page</a> says it’s being done by “the Dutch cooperation to find out the truth behind the events relating to 9/11/2001.”</p>
<p>The main contributor is also the founder, Jama Poulsen, or “Walden,” according to a <a href="http://wikicompany.org/wiki/index.php?title=Wikicompany:Wikicompany_v_Wikipedia&amp;oldid=41819">Wikicompany page</a>. He has posted hundreds of innocuous articles about companies. But, since about a year ago, it looks like he’s dedicated himself to informing us about the Jesuits, the Masons, the Trilateral Commission, etc. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Vatican-Jesuit-Masonic mafia network has been the primary origin of high-crimes over the past centuries: wars, assassinations, organized torture, enslavement, religious prosecution, state treason, censorship, history falsification, and judicial and economic fraud.
Yikes! I don’t think we’ll be mining Wikicompany for company data (unless my facist overlords tell me to).</p>
