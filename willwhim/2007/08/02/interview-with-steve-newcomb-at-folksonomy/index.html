He describes life and work at Powerset, some of the risks, the culture of openness at Powerset,  and why we don’t see Google as the enemy. Granted, it’s not a hard-hitting interview (Liu even says “I am looking forward to … exploring long-term career opportunties in Powerset,” which blunts one’s objectivity), but it gives a good picture of what Powerset is like. One of the things I like best about working at Powerset is being able to work with Steve, and this gives a flavor of why, too.  </p>
<p>Unrelated to this completely, but today I learned that a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->coulter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is “a sharp steel wedge that precedes the plow and cuts vertically through the soil.” Is it possibly true that “Coulter” is Ann Coulter’s  real family name? </p>
