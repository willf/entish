<p>n the Student Assembly meeting of the Associated Students of MSU, held Nov. 30, the Assembly agreed to vote for a bill that will create on-campus education activities to help encourage students’ action against the genocide in Darfur. The activities have been planned by the MSU Chapter of worldwide student network “Students Taking Action Now: Darfur.” “I am confident that the voting process will favor support for the ASMSU and S.T.A.N.D. partnership,” said Mark Fitzgerald, director of Communication &amp; Marketing of ASMSU. S.T.A.N.D. is a student-based anti-genocide coalition that is composed of over 600 high school and college chapters dedicated to eradicating genocide, specifically the ongoing genocide in Darfur, Sudan.
(Good luck, Mark!)</p>
