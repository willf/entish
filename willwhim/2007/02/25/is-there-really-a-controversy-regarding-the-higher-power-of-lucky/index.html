<p>The New York Times says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On electronic mailing lists like Librarian.net, dozens of literary blogs and pages on the social-networking site LiveJournal, teachers, authors and school librarians took sides over the book. Librarians from all over the country, including Missoula, Mont.; upstate New York; Central Pennsylvania; and Portland, Ore., weighed in, questioning the role of the librarian when selecting — or censoring, some argued — literature for children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, librarians “<a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/pdf/ocos068.pdf">held about 159,000 jobs in 2004.</a>” Compare this to the ‘dozens’ of blogs mentioning it, including a post on <a href="http://www.librarian.net/stax/1978">librarian.net</a>–which, is definitely <em>not</em> an electronic mailing list, the Times’s unfact-checked assertion to the contrary. I suppose by now this story has been parishiltoned–it’s now famous for being famous. But I wish that the media (both mainstream and alternative) would do the simplest of facts before calling something “controversial” there should be considerably more than a few dozen people are upset on either side of an issue. Sure, the Lucky story was a story–but it was a local story, not worth national exposure. This is no evidence of a vast conspiracy or vast stupidity or vast anything.</p>
<p>And the ‘blogosphere is abuzz’ is a hackneyed phrase, but this story is a hackneyed story. Please put it to rest.</p>
