<blockquote>
<p>In 1963, when the Rev. Vernon Tyson was pastor of Jonesboro Methodist Church in Sanford, he invited Dr. Samuel Proctor to preach for what was called Race Relations Sunday. Proctor, an African-American and one of the leading theologians in the United States until his death in 1997, was then president of North Carolina A&amp;T in Greensboro. When Tyson invited him to Sanford, Proctor laughed and said, “Yes, and we’ll be run out of town together.”
