<p>JORDAN. By J.J.H. I LOOKED to the South, and I looked to the West, And I saw old Slavery a comin’, With four Northern doughfaces hitched up in front, Driving Freedom to the other side of Jordan. Then take off coats, boys, roll up sleeves, Slavery is a hard foe to battle, I believe.</p>
<p>Slavery and Freedom, they both had a fight, And the whole North came up behind ’em, Hit Slavery a few knocks, with a free ballot box, Sent it staggering to the other side of Jordan. Take off, etc.</p>
<p>If I was the Legislature of these United States, I’d settle this great question accordin’; I’d let every slave go free, over land and on the sea, Let ’em have a little hope this side of Jordan. Then rouse up, ye freeman, the sword unsheath ; Freedom is the best road to travel, I believe.</p>
<p>The South have their school, where the masters learn to rule, And they lord it o’er the Free States accordin’ ; But sure they’d better quit, ere they rouse the Yankee grit, And we tumble ’em over t’other side of Jordan. Take off, etc.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and Vermont have surely come to want, To raise such scamps as Buck and Stephen, And they’d better hire John Mitchell with shillalah, club, and switchel, D rive ’em down to Alabama, and leave ’em. Then take off coats, boys, roll up sleeves ; Slavery is a hard foe to battle.</p>
<p>But the day is drawing nigh that Slavery must die, And every one must do his part accordin’ ; Then let us all unite to give every man his right, And we’ll get our pay the other side of Jordan. Then rouse up, ye freemen, the sword unsheath ; Freedom is the best road to travel, I believe.</p>
