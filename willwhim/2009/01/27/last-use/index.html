<p>And so it seems: the OED reports several senses of “homely” with gemütlich connotations. For example, “Become as one of the household; familiar, intimate; at home with”, now rare or obsolete. The first citation is from 865 ad. (“þis mane, þat vas hamely Vith hyme”/”this man that was <em>homely</em> with him.”)</p>
<p>But of course “homely” is only use as a synonym for “ugly” these days, I think; though “homey” is still used in certain contexts. I can say your house is homey, and I can even call you my homie (from homeboy), but I can’t say “this man that was homey with him” either.</p>
<p>It does make me wonder–do lexicographers ever try to find the <em>last</em> use of a term?</p>
