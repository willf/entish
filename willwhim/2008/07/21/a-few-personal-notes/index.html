<li>I’m looking forward to a family reunion of all my brothers (five of us!) this coming weekend.</li>
<li>I’ve been off to California a couple of times to meet about the Microsoft purchase, and I got my first “Microsoft Live!” tee-shirt</li>
<li>Summer in Michigan is a wonderful thing this year.</li>
<li>We just had our one-year anniversary of living in ‘the new house.’ So I guess it isn’t the new house, especially since we finally sold the old one.</li>
