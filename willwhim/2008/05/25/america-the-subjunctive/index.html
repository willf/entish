In particular, it uses verbs in the subjunctive mood, which is quite unusual in modern English, except in fixed expressions (such as “God forbid.”). The subjunctive is usually used to describe a condition that doesn’t exist, or a condition that one wishes to exist, such as “if I were a rich man.”</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the subjunctive in English is that it often indistinguishable from the simple past tense or a request/command form. In “<a href="http://www.powerset.com/explore/go/God-bless-America">http://www.powerset.com/explore/go/God-bless-America</a>,” you can tell it’s not the past tense (that would be “God blessed America, of course), but it’s a bit ambiguous about the command: does it mean “May God bless America” (the subjunctive) or “God, (please) bless America!” (the command form). From the context, it’s clearly addressed to God directly: before the chorus, <a href="http://www.scoutsongs.com/lyrics/godblessamerica.html">Berlin’s lyrics</a> say, ‘we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.”</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.powerset.com/explore/semhtml/America_the_Beautiful">America the Beautiful</a>” is not addressed to God; God is explicitly in the third person:</p>
<p>America! America! God shed His grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.</p>
<p>Does it mean that God has shed grace on America, or is a hope that God may shed grace on America? Only by looking at the second line can we tell: “And crown thy good…”. If it were the past tense, it would be “And crowned thy good…”, but it’s in the bare form, and so must be the subjunctive.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the second verse changes into the past tense (a verse rarely sung):</p>
<p>O beautiful, for pilgrim feet Whose stern, impassioned stress A thoroughfare for freedom beat Across the wilderness!</p>
<p>In theory, this is ambiguous: it could mean “May pilgrim feet beat across the wilderness,” but it’s clear that when <a href="http://www.powerset.com/explore/semhtml/Katharine_Lee_Bates">Katharine Lee Bates</a> wrote “America the Beautiful” in the 1890’s, she wasn’t hoping for a new pilgrim exodus across the continent, but was expressing a manifest destiny already fulfilled. The second chorus returns to the subjunctive, though–it’s not “mended” and “confirmed,” but “mend” and “confirm:”</p>
<p>America! America! God mend thine ev’ry flaw; Confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty in law!</p>
<p>The second is somewhat similar (gratitude for “heroes proved in liberating strife” and a subjunctive hope in the chorus that “God thy gold refine, ’til all success be nobleness”–two subjunctives in a row there!</p>
<p>The last verse has always confused me. How could anyone in the 1890’s thing that:</p>
<p>Thine alabaster cities gleam Undimmed by human tears!</p>
<p>But in context, it’s a subjunctive-like dream:</p>
<p>O beautiful, for patriot dream That sees beyond the years, Thine alabaster cities gleam Undimmed by human tears!</p>
<p>In other words, patriots dream of a future where American cites gleam and are without tears.</p>
<p>Well, may God bless America, may God mend its every flaw, and continue to shed us with grace. And may our cities be clean and full of justice, and a sense of unity grow among all its people–from sea to shining sea.</p>
