<p>I found a great quotation, by the way, in Natalia’s draft of a MLA presentation she gave, <a href="https://webfiles.berkeley.edu/cecire/public_html/r1a/potterdraft1.pdf">“From Stone Tablet to Pensieve: Media and History in Children’s Fantasy</a>“:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[J.K.] Rowling [in the Harry Potter books] fashions a world of superior hypermimesis, an information culture enhanced by the magic, which, when sufficiently advanced, is indistinguishable from technology.
It’s great fun to sing in a convention organized by Natalia. Not only did it run like clockwork, she’s apt to lean over and point out that the images in the 19th century text of <a href="http://fasola.org/indexes/1991/?p=532">Peace and Joy</a> also appear in the Old English poem, <a href="http://faculty.uca.edu/~jona/texts/rood.htm">The Dream of the Rood</a>:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://fasola.org/indexes/1991/?p=532">Peace and Joy</a>:</p>
<p>From the cross the radiance streaming Adds more luster to the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://faculty.uca.edu/~jona/texts/rood.htm">The Dream of the Rood</a>:</p>
<p>Listen! The choicest of visions I wish to tell, which came as a dream in middle-night, after voice-bearers lay at rest. It seemed that I saw a most wondrous tree born aloft, wound round by light, brightest of beams.</p>
