I do a lot of the teaching at our <a href="http://kmenno.org">church</a>, and more recently have been trying to write out my teaching notes and to send them to people who are interested or just unable to attend on a given Sunday. It’s a lot easier to do a teaching from an outline than to write everything down so that it’s semi-coherent, and that takes a significant amount of time. We’re trying to be more deliberate about posting these teachings on the church website as well as on Facebook. And that, too takes time.</p>
<p>And about Facebook and Twitter. The 140 character limit of a Twitter ‘tweet’ is just right for a lot of the statusey things I write, and often attracts comments (both on Facebook and in person) that posting on the weblog doesn’t. For example, yesterday I twitted: “Thanks to Brad &amp; Karen Bahler &amp; others, I got to sing “Hoboken style” with the David &amp; Johnny Lee in Indiana yesterday.”, and got two comments, one from a friend in Canada (“What exactly is Hoboken style”) and one from California, “Oooo… you lucky dog!” And, writing code takes a lot of time and effort.</p>
<p>So, I find myself writing either much longer things than I typically blog about as church teaching, or much shorter, conversational tweets on Facebook and Twitter. But I like the blog format, and am somewhat inspired to be more deliberative about it. A weblog post about blogging doesn’t really count, though.</p>
<p>I’d better go off and think of something to say.</p>
