<blockquote>
<p>How many unique ways are there to acquire at least 270 electoral votes without any excess?
I figured it would be a ‘large’ number, but I was surprised at the actual total: 51,199,463,116,367 (or, fifty-one trillion and change). about 2.3% of all possible combinations (This <em>exact</em> number is based on the simplifying assumption of treating Maine and Nevada as giving up their electoral votes in the same way as all the other states). <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/06/homework-assignment.html#comment-1544536678590316548">The answer was given by Isabel Lugo</a>, a mathematician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you blindly checked all the possibilities at a rate of 1000 per second, it would take over 17,000 centuries. <a href="http://www.thingsyoungerthanmccain.com/">That’s older than John McCain</a>.</p>
