<p>Slate has a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/books/2012/11/computer_programming_10_print_chr_205_5_rnd_1_goto_10_from_mit_press_reviewed.html">review of a new book with the obscure title 10 PRINT CHR$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO 10</a>, and this brings back such memories of typing in games from Basic Computer Games. The Basic program above prints (forever) as seen in this clip: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo</a></a>.</p>
<p>The magic here is that the computer is printing either a left or a right angled line character over and over; this looks like a maze. And it assumes that the left and right angled line characters have encodings of 205 or 206 (which was true in the Commodore 64’s character set, and almost nowhere else).</p>
<p>It also assumes a monoface glyph for these that fills up the entire line spacing (and no space between lines). It was all these hidden assumptions that made looking at those computer games so maddening, and, sometimes, fun.</p>
<p>It’s possible to recreate this tiny program in “one line” of many modern computer languages, without being as obscure as the original Basic. The Commodore 64’s character set is long gone, but The Unicode character set defines codepoints for box drawings; two codepoints, ╱ (╱) and ╲ (╲) are just what we need (“box drawings light diagonal upper right to lower left” and “box drawings light diagonal lower left to upper right” are just what we need.</p>
<p>We limit our ‘maze’ to 10,000 characters. Another hidden assumption was the screen wouldn’t display so quickly that you couldn’t see the maze!</p>
