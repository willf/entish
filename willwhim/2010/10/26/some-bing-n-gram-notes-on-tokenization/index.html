<p>Here are a few things we can share right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segment boundaries use the special symbols <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, thus P(“<!-- raw HTML omitted --> hello there <!-- raw HTML omitted -->”) != P(“hello there”).</li>
<li>The GetConditionalProbability uses the last space character as the ‘word’ boundary, even if internally there are multiple tokens represented in that last ‘word’.  That is, GCP(“shown as-is”) is P(“as-is”|”shown”), not P(“is”|”shown as”).</li>
