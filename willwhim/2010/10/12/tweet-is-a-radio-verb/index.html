<blockquote>
<p>Twitter merely coined a verb meaning ‚Äúsend a message via Twitter‚Äù, but they didn‚Äôt specify what linguists call its subcategorization possibilities. They added the verb to the dictionary, but they didn‚Äôt specify its grammar. The verb tweet is gradually developing its own syntax according to what it means and what its users regard as its combinatory possibilities. That is a really interesting, though unintended, large-scale natural experiment in how syntactic change works. And it is running right now, every minute of every day.
The suggestion is that the syntactic characteristics of <em>tweet</em> are as yet unknown. This suggestion is taken up by the Economist‚Äôs language weblog, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2010/10/syntactic_evolution">Johnson</a>. Because <em>tweet</em> doesn‚Äôt pattern as <em>say</em>, <em>write</em> or <em>tell</em>, they suggest, we have a chance to watch <em>linguistic evolution</em> occur right before our eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be foolish, of course, to suggest that <em>tweet</em>, in the sense suggested, is not new, and thus ‚Äúevolutionary.‚Äù We didn‚Äôt <em>tweet</em> before Twitter, and now we do. But a <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2693#comment-87971">comment on Pullum‚Äôs post</a> by <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler">John Lawler</a> suggested that <em>tweet</em> follows the pattern of verbs called ‚Äúverbs of instruments of Communication‚Äù in Beth Levin‚Äôs inestimable <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> verbal bestiary, <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=3630888"><em>English Verb Classes and Alterations: A Preliminary Investigation</em></a>. In Levin‚Äôs inventory, these verbs include</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cable e-mail fax modem netmail phone radio relay satellite sign semaphore signal telecast telegraph telephone telex wire wireless<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
One way to think of these as having the meaning ‚Äúsend a message via a <em>x</em>‚Äù, where <em>x</em> is noun form of the verb. So, <em>cable</em> means <em>send a message via a cable</em>, <em>fax</em> means <em>send a message via a fax</em>, etc. Hmm, this looks familiar. A message sent via Twitter is a <em>tweet</em>, of course; so <em>to tweet</em> means <em>send a message via a tweet</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is: does linguistic evidence support this? To begin to answer this, I <a href="http://willwhim.wordpress.com/2010/10/11/computational-lexicography-on-the-cheap-using-twitter/">downloaded a lot of tweets</a> from Twitter. Not surprisingly, this is a good source of the use of <em>tweet</em> in the sense required. In sum, there is a lot of evidence to support its has the syntactic properties of a ‚Äúradio‚Äù verb, plus a few special features of its own.</p>
<p>To show this, I will present each of Levin‚Äôs ‚Äúproperties‚Äù of radio verbs, along with her example verb <em>cable</em> side-by-side with <em>tweet</em>; and then several examples of <em>tweet</em> used in this way. There is two <em>negative</em> properties which requires further discussion.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Parenthetical Use of the Verb Given the informal register of most Twitter messages, I did not find any examples of parenthetical uses.¬†
<ol>
<li>The winner, Heather cabled (Sarah) , would be announced tonight. / The winner, Heather tweeted (Sarah) , would be announced tonight.¬†</li>
<li>The winner, Heather cabled (to Sarah) , would be announced tonight. / The winner, Heather tweeted (to Sarah) , would be announced tonight.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Zero-related Nominal: a cable / a tweet
<ul>
<li>These type of tweets makes my day.</li>
<li>If I am sharing my ‚Äúfirst tweet with the world‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt it be much more profound that this???</li>
<li>@YasminTMB your last tweet was the funniest thing I have read all day haha</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the negative cases (574. Heather cabled/tweeted to Sarah, 575. Heather cabled/tweeted at Sarah), I found examples of both. Here are some examples of ‚Äútweeted to‚Äù:</p>
<ul>
<li>Me &amp; My followers didn‚Äôt tweet a lot becuz of some of them haven‚Äôt tweeted to me just once so I‚Äôve not even know they exist üòõ</li>
<li>@MidnaBella Amanda tweeted to the wrong person, fewl.</li>
<li>@LucyEdwards96 if you look at dans tweets he tweeted to me but i just want to make sure he‚Äôs okay and for him to know its from me üôÇ xx</li>
</ul>
<p>And some examples of ‚Äútweeted at‚Äù:</p>
<ul>
<li>@silvsthesex no I was jus sayin I hadn‚Äôt seen u in my timeline ky33, not knowing u had tweeted at me</li>
<li>I tweeted at myself. I‚Äôm tired. Meant to tweet @Birdflaps</li>
<li>@Geektastic_Tim hey i just saw you tweeted at me last night‚Ä¶ i am great. how are you!?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the ‚Äútweet to‚Äù case, I‚Äôm not that sure that ‚Äúcabled to/radioed to/faxed to‚Äù are that incorrect. Consider these variants (having formalized the register a bit):</p>
<ul>
<li>My friends and I didn‚Äôt cable/radio/fax one another a lot‚Äîsome of them haven‚Äôt cabled/radioed/faxed to me even once.</li>
<li>Amanda cabled/radioed/faxed to the wrong person.</li>
<li>If you look at Dan‚Äôs cables/radio messages/faxes, he cabled/radioed/faxed to me, but I just want to be sure he‚Äôs okay.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the ‚Äútweet at‚Äù examples, I would suggest that when a <em>broadcasting</em> verb is used (that is, a medium of communication which is one-to-many), the ‚Äúat‚Äù construction is more acceptable. ‚ÄúHeather cabled at Sarah‚Äù is odd, because a cable is physically delivered to a person. But imagine a large corporation sending scattershot cables or faxes to potential customers. Then, ‚ÄúGizmatron cabled/faxed at their potential customers‚Äù seems more acceptable. The ‚Äútweeted at‚Äù examples, though, are odd because in each of the cases cited it is clear there is a one-to-one message implied. So, this is perhaps a special syntactic feature of <em>tweet</em>. Still, it is worth noting that Twitter is simultaneously a one-to-one medium and a one-to-many medium. The author may tweet to a specific person, but everyone (or all followers in the normal case) can see the tweet. So, this broadcasty nature of Twitter may allow more flexibility in the use of ‚Äútweet at.‚Äù</p>
<p>Additional similarities</p>
<p>There are other similarities between <em>tweet</em> and the other verbs of instrument of communication brought out by the Twitter data. Below, I have sanitized the data, but they are all backed by <em>tweet</em> examples. (Some of these have technical names, but I‚Äôve spent too long on this post already.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Use with _back_: Heather tweeted/cabled Sarah back.</li>
<li>Use with _about_: Heather tweeted/cabled Sarah about her condition</li>
<li>Use with adverbial phrases of frequency. Heather tweeted/cabled Sarah too much.</li>
<li>Use with adverbial phrases of duration. Heather hasn‚Äôt tweeted/cabled Sarah for two days.</li>
<li>Use with adverbial phrases of enumeration: Heather tweeted/cabled Sarah fifty times</li>
<li>use with points in time: Heather tweeted/cabled Sarah at midnight</li>
<li>Usable as a filler in ‚ÄúThe Revolution will not be [televised]‚Äù: The Revolution will not be tweeted/cabled</li>
<li>Usable as an adjective: It was the most tweeted/cabled event.</li>
<li>Usable with inter-group reflexives: Heather and Sarah tweeted/cabled each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>So, I would like to suggest that <em>tweet</em> is a <em>radio</em> verb; that is, one of Levin‚Äôs ‚ÄúVerbs of Instrument of Communication.‚Äù More analysis is required, of course‚Äîthere‚Äôs a dissertation lurking in here, I‚Äôm sure. But if you have any comments, please write me below. Or feel free to tweet/cable/fax/phone/signal/sms/message/text/wire/email me. Unfortunately, you won‚Äôt be able to netmail or satellite me your responses.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I know I‚Äôve just used <em>inestimable</em> for a second time. It‚Äôs because, you see, both Language Log and <em>English Verb Classes and Alterations</em> are inestimable. Deal with it. If you care about language, you really need to read Language Log and Beth Levin‚Äôs book.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Some of these verbs are obsolete now, of course, and I don‚Äôt recall ever seeing <em>satellite</em> used as a verb, but this doesn‚Äôt affect this discussion much.</p>
