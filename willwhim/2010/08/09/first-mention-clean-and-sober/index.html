<p>The first clear use of this expression in the New York Times archives is from August 28, <strong>1892</strong>, which has the embedded note in an article about a murder trial:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEAR MISS CLOVER: WIll you meet me outside the Canterbury at 7:30 to-night? DO you remember the night I bought your boots? You were too drunk to speak to me. If you come <strong>clean and sober</strong>, please bring this paper and evenelope with you.

<a href="http://www.lippsisters.com/2010/08/08/the-unfactchecked-aa-facts/comment-page-1/#comment-49602">Someone else</a> found hundreds of references in Google Books. So it’s ok to say Freddy was clean and sober; I hope he stays that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Update: going back to find original discussion which got me thinking.</p>
