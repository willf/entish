This is a tune I had been leading a lot at Sacred Harp singings and conventions in 2009; I still like it. One silly reason is that the tune’s title indicates a goal of a good search engine. The title actually comes from an <a href="http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/texts/HappyMatches.txt">Isaac Watts poem</a> about the difficulty of good marriage matches, according to Warren Steele.</p>
<p>In the 1991 Denson edition of the Sacred Harp, there is a fermata in the antepenultimate measure; I spent a long time thinking about how long to hold this. It is sometimes held just the shortest extra time. But Wade Kotter had brought an early copy of the Sacred Harp to the singing, and I noticed that there was no fermata, but two tied-half notes. You can see this for yourself at the online version of BF White’s <a href="http://digital.lib.msu.edu/collections/index.cfm?action=view&amp;TitleID=610&amp;Format=jpg&amp;PageNum=95">1860 edition of the Sacred Harp</a> at Michigan State; a similar thing is true of the version in the <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/walker/harmony/files/gif/Willoughby/710.html">Southern Harmony</a> (where the tune is called “Willoughby,” from whence BF White might easily have taken it.</p>
<p>This gave me justification for holding it for a longish time. In fact, Tom Malone (dear friend and singing master) has suggested that a fermata <em>stops time</em>, a very interesting philosophical puzzle. Listening to <a href="http://www.bostonsing.com/app/download/3996575557/096+Few+Happy+Matches.mp3?t=1281224937">Few Happy Matches</a> now is very suggestive. It does feel like <em>time is being stopped</em> as we sing <em>who sometimes are afraid to <strong>die</strong>—</em>.</p>
<p>It may be that you’ll experience <em>time being stopped</em> as you listen or sing this tune.</p>
