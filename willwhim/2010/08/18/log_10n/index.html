<p>The API returns base 10 logs for its probabilities. Because the probabilities returned are so very low, it makes more sense to return a log probability. I could be wrong, but I think it’s normal practice to return base 2 logs, or base <em>e</em> logs for log probabilities. They are easily to convert from one base to another, so it doesn’t really matter. But I was wondering why base 10 logs are returned.</p>
<p>The penny dropped when I was just playing around printing out base 10 of some probabilities:</p>
<p>log<!-- raw HTML omitted -->10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(1.0) = 0.0 log<!-- raw HTML omitted -->10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(0.1) = -1.0 log<!-- raw HTML omitted -->10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(0.01) = -2.0 log<!-- raw HTML omitted -->10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->(0.001) = -3.0</p>
<p>I felt silly (since log<!-- raw HTML omitted -->10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->x = y by definition means x = 10<!-- raw HTML omitted -->y<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). But it’s really helpful to look at a number like ‑5.2721823 and know there are 5 zeros to the right of the decimal point. It’s even easier to parse than 0.0000053434.</p>
