      <description>Of Truth
Francis Bacon, translated by Will Fitzgerald August 1, 2015
“What is truth?” asked jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Certainly there have been those who delight in giddiness, and count it bondage to settle on a belief, who affect free will in thinking as well as in acting. And though the schools of philosophers of that kind are gone, there remain certain chattering wits of the same vein—though not with as much blood in them as there was in the ancients.</description>

It’s been a remarkable weekend of eating for me this weekend. Searching for a place to grab a quick bite with other out-of-town friends while we were all in Chicago, we fired up an app on our iPhones to seek a nearby place.</description>

      <description>I won the Listserve lottery, and sent this story out to about 13k people today. It was a revision of something I’d written a while back.
Patrick of Ireland
Once upon a time — and listen, for although this sounds like a fable, I will try to make every word true — once upon a time there was a young boy named Patrick, a young Christian boy whose father was a deacon, and whose grandfather was a priest.</description>

      <title>Amish forgiveness and Amish shunning</title>

      <description>Last night, I watched the American Experience documentary on the Amish, which I thought very well done. They treated the Amish with respect, neither nostalgically nor scornfully, with beautiful camera work, well-crafted stories, and good expert commentary. Personally, I especially enjoyed hearing some Amish singing, especially O Gott Vater, which I have never heard sung.
They told the story of the 2006 Nickel Mines tragedy, in which a man shot ten Amish girls in a schoolhouse, killing five of them, and of the amazing forgiveness the Amish showed the killer (who died in the attack) and the killer’s family.</description>

      <title>Atheists and agnostics know more about religion than the religious people. So what?</title>
      <link>http://example.org/2010/09/29/atheists-and-agnostics-know-more-about-religion-than-the-religious-people-so-what/</link>

      <description>The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life released a report on how much Americans know about some religious facts; they have a online quiz version of their survey that’s making the rounds.
NPR reported on this in their story “Survey: Atheists, Agnostics Know More About Religion Than Religious,” and the LA Times did as well in their story “Atheists, agnostics most knowledgeable about religion, survey says.” For some reason, the actual report from the Pew Forum is unavailable as I write, but much of the details can be found at the online quiz.</description>

      <guid>http://example.org/2010/08/16/christians-for-freedom-of-religion/</guid>
      <description>Can I a tiny shout-out from other US Christians who are grateful to live in a country that has religious freedom built into the very core of its democracy and constitution? And that, therefore, efforts to curtail the religious rights of Muslims near the 9/11 site should be resisted?
It seems ridiculous that there would be any issue here at all.

      <description>I’ve been meaning to make a weblog of The Shewings of Julian of Norwich available for sometime, and I’ve finally done it:
http://shewings.wordpress.com
Consider it a Christmas present.
Julian (or Juliana) lived in the English village of Norwich in the fourteenth century. She received sixteen “Shewings” (or “Revelations”) which she later wrote down; these were separated into 86 chapters. This weblog will post two chapters, one on Saturday, one on Wednesday.</description>

      <description>At nearly the last minute, Tom Malone suggested that we drive down to Camp Fasola on the Sunday before Camp began in the evening, and return on Thursday, the last day of Camp. I had to work on Friday (“Work—the curse of the singing class,” quipped Richard Schmeidler at dinner one day), and Tom is in the midst of a move back east. So, it was convenient to do this—as if driving 13 hours one way is anyone’s idea of ‘convenient.</description>

      <description>A response to R Dean Hudgens’s Tongues and Tribes: Musical Change in a Mennonite Congregation.
I am very, very grateful for the time I spent at Reba Place Church (1990-1996, 1998 or so), and loved the music there. I was very grateful for the intentional way that the call to anti-racism worked itself out in music and worship. This included being part of the gospel choir, which developed my spirit and my musical abilities and helped me on an anti-racist path.</description>

      <description>Aristotle’s Feminist Subject: interesting weblog:
 This blog has been a way to interact with some of you around “subjects” that Aristotle has taught too many of us in the west, even today, to disparage: females, rhetoric, and translation. Until we’ve recovered, I guess I’ll blog a bit more . Also: The WOMBman’s Bible

 We follow Jesus, who lived, died, and rose again to save us. He tells us to love God and to love our neighbor as ourselves.

      <description>See it full size for the best effect, I think: Psalm 131. I made this slide show for worship this past Sunday, using CC photographs from Flickr, and music from Lindsay Phillips. It was prompted by Psalm 131:
Lord, my heart is not lifted up, my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me.
But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like the weaned child that is with me.</description>

      <description>Here’s a labor of love: the Harmonia Sacra online.
The Harmonia Sacra is a shape-note tunebook in the Mennonite tradition. Originally published in 1832 by Joseph Funk as A Compilation of Genuine Church Music, it has gone through twenty-six editions. This on-line version provides both seven-shape and four-shape (“Sacred Harp”-style) versions of tunes.
I created a website (static website, but generated with Ruby) using James Nelson Gingerich’s excellent newly typeset versions of this tune book.</description>

      <description>Fred Clark gets it:
 One of the first questions when approaching the subject of human nature tends to be are we essentially good or essentially rotten? The Christian answer — “Yes!” — can seem like a cop-out, or a contradiction, or a paradox (the euphemism theologian’s use for those contradictions we like). The idea is that every human is of inestimable worth, bearing the very image of God through and through.</description>

The general website is at ‘Blessed Hope Services‘. One very nice hymn is ‘Beside the gospel pool’ (mp3). I love how you can often hear the children in the background.</description>

      <description>This past weekend, Bess, Jane and I attended the 50th anniversary of the founding of Reba Place Church, the church we attended in the 90’s when I was in graduate school and for a few years afterwards. Saturday was spent going though a decade by decade retrospective. Reba began as, essentially, a commune in the 50’s and experienced explosive growth through the 60s and 70s. They allowed non-communal members in the 80s and there were many aftershocks of many of the communal members becoming everyday variety congregational members.</description>

Kelly has been a friend of Bess’s since high school, and Susan Ford Clark, Kelly’s wife, shared an apartment with Bess their senior year–in fact, Kelly and Susan, and Bess and I, were married on the same day in the same church (at different times).</description>

On Saturday, I attended the Golden Gate Sacred Harp singing in San Francisco (with a nice Après-chant at Philip’s house, nicely described by Linda, who also has pictures of the singing). In the morning today, Jeff Shrager took me to see redwoods and banana slugs and tidepools, capped by some nice bluegrass music at a cafe. Worship at Sojourners was also good.
Back in Michigan, I missed some cool things happening.</description>

      <description>Excellent teaching by Debbie Gish at Church of the Sojourners in San Francisco, Reading the Revelation at Lent. Excerpt:
 Like it or not, which often I don’t, we are actually in a battle, in a war. Being strong, being focused, being whole hearted and single-minded are painfully necessary….This isn’t a war of survival; this is a war of conquering. And in order to conquer, not just survive, we gotta get the Enemies ways and means out of our system.</description>

      <description>The Rev. Vernon Tyson remembers ‘Miss Amy’s witness,’ during the civil rights era in Raleigh, North Carolina.
 In 1963, when the Rev. Vernon Tyson was pastor of Jonesboro Methodist Church in Sanford, he invited Dr. Samuel Proctor to preach for what was called Race Relations Sunday. Proctor, an African-American and one of the leading theologians in the United States until his death in 1997, was then president of North Carolina A&amp;amp;T in Greensboro.</description>

      <description>St. Basil, who lived from around 330-379 CE, is one of the “three hierarchs” of the Orthodox Church. I’ve just finished reading (in a translation by RJ Deferrai), an excellent essay On the distinction between ousia and hypostasis. In this letter, he writes very clearly about the Christian view of God as Triune, in particular explaining the meaning of the technical terms ousia (abstract being) and hypostasis (individual being).
It’s good as a piece of theology, but it’s also interesting as clear technical writing.</description>

      <description>Maggie Leonard, responding to Linda’s statement about singing Sacred Harp that I quoted recently:
 That says it all. I’m not a doctrinal Christian. I tried for years to accept the doctrinal view of Jesus, but couldn’t when I searched my soul. However, this music rises beyond doctrine and summons the spirit that moved among the apostles after Jesus’ passing. That spirit moves through us like water when we sing, cleansing and purifying.</description>

      <description>The first worship service of the Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship happened yesterday–five people (including Bess, Jane and me) were present. Jane revealed the ‘psalm, hymn or spiritual song’ she’s been keeping secret: O Come, O Come Imannuel. I began a series on the Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective; the first article is on God (I spoke in favor). Bess made chili and bean soup for afterwards; one participant, Carolyn, brought her own can of soup just in case the soup being served contained beans, which was wonderfully prescient of her.</description>

Nothing disturb thee, Nothing frighten. All things pass away, God never changes. It is with patience that All things are completed. For those who have God, Nothing is lacking. God alone is sufficient.

      <description>And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth. (John 1:14)
Let all mortal flesh keep silence, And with fear and trembling stand; Ponder nothing earthly minded, For with blessing in His hand, Christ our God to earth descendeth, Our full homage to demand.
King of kings, yet born of Mary, As of old on earth He stood, Lord of lords, in human vesture, In the body and the blood; He will give to all the faithful His own self for heavenly food.</description>

      <description>Rachel Miller Jacobs, of Kern Street Mennonite Church in South Bend, Indiana, was ordained yesterday. Rachel is one of the Goshen, Indiana Sacred Harp singers, and it was with great pleasure that some of us were able to sing as a prelude to her ordination service, which was marked by good prayers, lovely singing, an excellent call to ministry by one of her seminary professors, and much obvious love for Rachel by the congregration she serves as the minister of spiritual formation, and by Rachel for the people she serves and from whom she has learned.</description>

      <description>I’ve been quite enjoying reading The Barn at the End of the World, by Mary Rose O’Reilley, published by Milkweed Press. It reminds me a lot of the writing of Annie Dillard (who has her own website: ‘The Secrets of the Universe as Decoded by the Unhinged’): essays about mindfulness at the interface between the natural and artificial worlds, as well at the interface of the social and solitary life. O’Reilly has a kind of spiritual eclecticism (not only is she a Quaker Buddhist shepherd, but a former Catholic novitiate) that I find both appealing and a bit scandalous–why is this Quaker/Catholic bowing before a buddha?</description>

 The Emerging Church: This is a term that refers to churches attended exclusively by white people in their 20s and 30s who have at least one tattoo or body piercing. Their distinguishing characteristics are a refreshing, “up to date” interpretation of Christianity, and a reluctance to directly answer questions. He also explains the code from Vinci:</description>

 The manuscript of the first protest against slavery in North America — written in Germantown in 1688 by a group that included Quakers and former Mennonites — has been rediscovered more than 50 years after it was last seen. The document was uncovered this spring in the vault at the Arch Street Friends Meetinghouse in downtown Philadelphia, according to Randy Nyce, director of the Germantown Mennonite Historic Trust.</description>

      <description>Extremely surprising article at über-evangelical Christianity Today: Messy Revelation: Why Paul would have flunked hermeneutics by historian and biblical studies expert Susan Wise Bauer. It’s a very positive review of a book by Peter Enns titled Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament. Enns argues that the New Testament writers interpreted the Hebrew scriptures in the writers’ own social and cultural context–the writers had come to believe in Jesus as the resurrected Messiah, and then found evidence in the scriptures.</description>

      <description>I’m not a theologian, but I’m not alone in thinking that traditional evangelicalism (especially with its increased association with political conservatism) seems an inadequate response to a theology that fits well with Christian “experience and doxology.” In fact, I discovered what is almost a manifesto: Postconservative Evangelicals Greet the Postmodern Age. For example:
 Postconservatives tend to be impatient with exclusive claims to “the correct interpretation” of the Bible or tradition.</description>

 THERE is no such thing as a “Christian politics.” If it is a politics, it cannot be Christian. Jesus told Pilate: “My reign is not of this present order. If my reign were of this present order, my supporters would have fought against my being turned over to the Jews. But my reign is not here” (John 18:36). Jesus brought no political message or program.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time–back in the early 80’s–I taught English as a Second Language. A number of my students were Bahá’ís from Iran. I remember one student in particular who wasn’t doing very well, and whom I had to ask to come to my office to discuss her academic situation. It turned out that she was very motivated to correct any problems she was having, because if she failed and lost her student visa, she would have to return to Iran, and face the ongoing persecution of Bahá’í believers by the Shia-controlled government.</description>

Lesser oppressors came and surrounded me as well. Surrounded my friends, and me. Yet I held out the Light, even as they hid us, And pursued justice in places of fear and anger.</description>

      <description>From Bridging the Church Music Gap, Sojourners Magazine/March 2006
 [A] number of churches that approach music from one pole or the other also dabble in less familiar material. Organists gamely plod through choruses, and praise bands rock out on old warhorse hymns. … But too often, this sort of music is programmed as an exception to the dominant pattern of whichever polarized model. Thus the overall tone of a service’s music—a deal-breaker for many people—is not really changed.</description>

The first tune is “An Anthem for Thanksgiving.” (You can hear it here: WGUC 90.9 FM | Feast for the Ears; it’s the first tune in the 2005 program). The first part of the text is taken from Psalm 148, and then continues with these great words:
Ye dragons whose contagious breath, People the dark abodes of death, Change your dire hissings into heavenly songs, And praise your maker with your forked tongues.</description>

      <description>There’s been a little discussion about The Huron Carol on the hymns list. This is the carol that, in the usual English version goes:
‘Twas in the moon of winter-time When all the birds had fled, That mighty Gitchi Manitou Sent angel choirs instead; Before their light the stars grew dim, And wandering hunter heard the hymn: “Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born, In excelsis gloria.”
The Huron Carol is thought to be the first Canadian carol.</description>

      <description>On November 26, four members of the Christian Peacemaker Teams were kidnapped in Iraq by a previously unknown group called the Swords of Righteousness. The CPT team was in Iraq investigating abuses by the occupying forces (they provided some of the first news on Abu Ghraib and other abuse cases in Iraq). Their motto is being “committed to reducing violence by ‘Getting in the way,&amp;rsquo;” which means putting themselves in dangerous spots just so violence may be reduced because of public pressure, changes of heart, putting on spotlight on abuse, etc.</description>

      <description>I saw the Chronicles Of Narnia movie this weekend. My biggest fear was that Disney would tinker with the story too much; this fear was unfounded. It’s a respectful and fairly faithful telling of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan is still not a tame lion, and is good, not safe, and Professor Kirke still wonders What do they teach at schools these days? I doubt that the movie will evoke much Sehnsucht.</description>

Homily by a Fr. Jim Tucker:
 Si algo toca nuestro vivir, tiene que ser sometido al imperio del Rey Crucificado.
 What does “Viva el Cristo Rey” show up on serveral Persian blogs? For example, this one.
Can one be politically somewhat leftist and shout “¡Viva el Cristo Rey!” without too many echos of Francoist terrorism?
Good hymns for the Feast of Christ the King:</description>

I wrote this letter to Time:
 I’m fairly appalled at the patronizing tone Joel Stein takes in his column ‘What’s next…with the Amish,’ as posted on-line Oct 17: Stein could have chosen to ask how the Amish go about making decisions about new technologies rather than making fun of them or assuming that many are looking for ‘loopholes’ that would allow them to use cell phones and Rollerblades.</description>

The sticking point is, of course, the last phrase: “envious Jews.</description>

      <description>Donna Abrahams writes on the Fasola (Sacred Harp) mailing list:
 Judge Jackson himself wrote “Florida Storm.” Many regard it as the quintessential “Colored Sacred Harp” song. It immortalizes a category 4 hurricane known only as Hurricane #6 that hit the Gulf Coast — including southern Florida — in 1926. I kept thinking of the words all during Katrina, which (very sadly) turned out to be about as appropriate today as they were then.</description>

      <description>From Archibishop Ncube Urges Mugabe Overthrow
 Although Mugabe is regarded as evil incarnate by Zimbabwe’s Roman Catholic hierarchy, he does have friends elsewhere in the Christian Community. Zimbabwe’s Anglican primate, Bishop Nolbert Kunonga, has used his pulpit at St Mary’s Cathedral in Harare to support Mugabe and his land reform programme.
He was rewarded by Mugabe with one of the farms, St Marnock’s, outside Harare, confiscated from its previous white owner, 25-year-old Marcus Hale.</description>
