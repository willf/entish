Matt Cutts has a thoughtful follow-up articleon the controversy over whether Bing is copying Google’s search results.

Google has accused Bing of cheating, of copying Google’s results (Danny Sullivan’s article which broke the news; Google’s official blog post with the accusation). Basically, Google set up a honeypot of synthetic (that is, unique, non-word) search keys which their results led to specifically selected (i.

The Bing Ngram data gives us the tools: given “avoid like the”, the word “plague” occurs 98.68% of the time (in the web body data). The word “plaque” is the second most common word, occurring 0.

When Powerset began a couple of years ago, a lot of commentators called us — and still do call us — a would be Google killer. This, despite repeated comments by senior staff that this wasn’t what we were about. As a company, Google is hard to beat. Our goal was audacious, but not that audacious. Our goal was to build a better search experience: to use natural language technology to provide better search results, both by having a better understanding of web documents as well as user queries.

      I was reviewing a Wiki project, Wikicompany.org, today. Its stated mission is be a “free, worldwide business directory that anyone can edit,” in the same spirit as Wikipedia. I thought it might be a good resource for company names and facts.
But then I noticed that the vast majority of edits in the past sixty days are about the vast conspiracy behind 9/11 and the new world order. The original 9/11 start page says it’s being done by “the Dutch cooperation to find out the truth behind the events relating to 9/11/2001.

      There must be an antonym for ‘hype.’ To hype something is to engage in hyperbole about it: Apple products have generated their share of hype. (For example: Steve Jobs said, “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”) I don’t mean ‘anti-hype’ in the sense of telling the approximate truth about something, desengaño or dis-illusionment. But after the IPhone announcement, Steve Ballmer said, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.

He describes life and work at Powerset, some of the risks, the culture of openness at Powerset, and why we don’t see Google as the enemy. Granted, it’s not a hard-hitting interview (Liu even says “I am looking forward to … exploring long-term career opportunties in Powerset,” which blunts one’s objectivity), but it gives a good picture of what Powerset is like.

One of the many things that it takes for a computer to “understand” text (as we are trying to do at Powerset) is for it recognize names and what they refer to.

      Since the news is out about where Tim is going after he leaves Yahoo!, I’d like to welcome Tim Converse to Powerset. I’m looking forward to working with Tim again. We’ve had interesting working relationships in the past:
 He worked for me writing code to parse RAP System execution code under C++, I worked for him (and Joyce Park) doing webdev using Dynamorph, an unlamented language that preceded JSP and PHP and Ruby on Rails.

      Gulp.
David Smith at The Guardian hypes web 2.0 (or web 3.0) and writes “The new Google is … Powerset.”
Calm down, everyone. Read what Barney Pell (Powerset CEO), Lorenzo Thione (Product Architect) and Steve Newcomb (COO) are saying on their blogs, especially Barney’s comments on Google and Powerset in the Sunday Times:
 Search is in its early days, and natural language is the future of search. But it’s both difficult to enable natural language search at all, and to do it on a scale like Google is a harder matter still.

      Cool, the news is officially out: Powerset has raised $12.5 M in series A financing (our press release). Bambi Francisco wrote a story for MarketWatch, and did an interview with our CEO, Barney Pell. Great lead to Francisco’s story:
 So they must be crazy, have a high threshold for pain, or are certain to deliver a brilliant product, right? Update: And it feels even more real when it makes the New York Times (a Times blog, but still).

What’s that you say, a company can’t have a blog? That there’s no difference between a company blog and a press release? Silly you: Press releases talk about the company in the third person, have an about section, and a media contact.

      An article in Ventureblog about Powerset, the company I work for, has kicked up a minor storm in the blogosphere about Powerset and the very idea of natural language search. I’d just like to point people to a weblog post by Barney Pell, our CEO, on Powerset and Natural Language Search. For those who might wonder why I’m working for Powerset, Barney’s vision explains it well:
 Seen in this light, there is enormous room for fundamental innovation in search, as the game has only just begun.

      I think this is the first writeup of the company I work for, Powerset, that I’ve seen: Spying an intelligent search engine. Barney Pell, our CEO, is interviewed.
 Search engines try to train us to become good keyword searchers. We dumb down our intelligence so it will be natural for the computer,” said Pell, whose company, Powerset, is based in Palo Alto, Calif. “The big shift that will happen in society is that instead of moving human expressions and interactions into what’s easy for the computer, we’ll move computers’ abilities to handle expressions that are natural for the human,” he said.

      The always interesting Jean Veronis posts about page duplicates in English and French.
He investigates how many pages are returned for a search for the new word “ségolisme” (for which he can control at bit for precision numbers), and how many of these are duplicates due to RSS feeds, etc. A money quote:
 So, what are all these pages that Google considers to be similar? On closer inspection we can see that they are mainly RSS versions of the same page, archived pages (a blog often presents the same post in an individual version and also in a weekly or monthly archive), versions of posts both with and without comments, and links such as “trackback” or “new comments”, which are also commonplace on blogs.
