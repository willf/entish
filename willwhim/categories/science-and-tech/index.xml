      <title>What do you need to know to program FizzBuzz?</title>

      <description>I was showing my CS professor friend the hilarious “FizzBuzz in TensorFlow” post, and he’d actually had not heard of FizzBuzz. Basically FizzBuzz is a test to see if someone can do basic programming.
This got me to thinking about what you actually need to know about a particular programming language and software engineering to program FizzBuzz in.
Here’s a basic implementation in Go:
So I think these are the things you need to know (including the syntax of these in a particular language):</description>

      <description>Of Truth
Francis Bacon, translated by Will Fitzgerald August 1, 2015
“What is truth?” asked jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Certainly there have been those who delight in giddiness, and count it bondage to settle on a belief, who affect free will in thinking as well as in acting. And though the schools of philosophers of that kind are gone, there remain certain chattering wits of the same vein—though not with as much blood in them as there was in the ancients.</description>

      <description>To partially update an Elasticsearch document in 1.6, you’ll need to create a script for the partial update, and potentially use an upsert.
For example, you want to add tags to a blog post
here’s an example of a document created directly:
POST /website/blog/1/_update { “doc” : { “tags” : [ “testing” ], “views”: 0 } }
but if we want to add a tag without changing the view, you need to create a script in config/scripts</description>

      <description>Word vectors have become increasingly important in as features in machine learning models for natural language processing. The idea is to represent a word in some multidimensional space (the vector) in which words which are “similar” are similar in that space. Typically, one hopes that word vectors will provide some kind of semantic similarity. A typical party trick is to use word vectors to solve word analogy problems; e.g., king is to queen as man is to ?</description>

      <description>What is Named Entity Recognition? Named Entity Recognition (or NER) is the task of finding all the names of things in a text. For example, in the sentence “Jimi Hendrix played ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at Woodstock,” NER, correctly done, would find the references to “Jimi Hendrix,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and “Woodstock.” Note that NER should also extract names it has never previously seen; for example, in the sentence “Johannes von Smetly is the protagonist in Willard Smith’s new novel”, an NER system should extract “Johannes von Smetly” as a name, even if it it doesn’t appear in any standard name list.</description>

      <description>What is part of speech tagging? Part of speech tagging (POS tagging) is a classification problem: assigning each word or token in a text to a “part of speech,” that is, a lexical/grammatical class for each token. Different theories, or (perhaps more importantly) different uses will suggest different sets of grammatical labels, but they typically include nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. For example, the sentence “John thinks it’s all good.” might be tagged as:</description>

      <description>I was writing some Scala code which had a long series of somewhat complicated and expensive calculations to make, and in many cases I wanted to log the intermediate calculations. The first version of this code was quite complicated looking, because the calculations of the intermediate values and the logging statements were all intermixed.
But then I realized that I could create a separate object which maintained the state, and which performed the calculations, too.</description>

      <description>There is a controversy over “Computational linguistics and literary scholarship.” A paper published at the Association for Computational Linguistics David Bamman, Brendan O’Connor, &amp;amp; Noah A. Smith, “Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters“) has come under criticims by Hannah Alpert-Abrams with Dan Garrette, “Some thoughts on the relationship between computational linguistics and literary scholarship“. The primary criticism has been that the ACL paper fails to cite any literary scholarship past the middle of the last century.</description>

      <description>Well, I didn’t think I’d write another Fibonacci A Day post — but there’s a great fibonacci function that’s defined right in the Scala documents, in their discussion of Streams.
A stream is a standard Scala data structure which is very list like. Recall that a Scala list has two parts, a head and a tail; the head is a value, and the tail is either the special empty list (Nil), or another list.</description>

      <description>I am taking Martin Odensky’s Functional Programming in Scala class, and discovered (or rediscovered) that the Fibonacci function is discussed in SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, the book that Odensky seems to be basing much of his Functional Programming in Scala course on).
Even more interesting is that a Fibonacci function which runs in O(lg(n)) steps is presented — that is, it takes about lg(n) steps to compute the _n_th Fibonacci number, instead of n steps.</description>

      <description>The goal of this series was to come up with a general, efficient fibonacci function that goes beyond the typical computer science introduction. The version we developed is fast, efficient with respect to memory, and general. I’d be glad to hear comments.

      <description>We are now confident that the fast recursive version is the best of the algorithms we have explored — it is fast, and can handle large values of the Fibonacci function.
I haven’t been happy, though, with returning a negative -1 when the function is called with a negative number — this feels like a kind of silent error we were trying to avoid in going to BigInts. Fortunately, it turns out that there is a natural extension of the Fibonacci sequence to negative numbers.</description>

      <description>The following table describes the limits of the various Fibonacci algorithms I’ve created during this series. I ran them through a very simple benchmarking routine, and empirically tested them for the maximum size they can handle. Each benchmark was run 1000 times, except the first algorithm, which was run just once — we already know it runs too slow. These were run on a MacBook Air (Late 2010).

      <description>Although the iterative recursive version is stateless, it looks different from the standard mathematical definition. The recursive version is a very close mapping, but it’s extremely inefficient. One way to overcome the inefficiencies is to dynamically record (or memoize) previous calculations of F(n). The idea is simple — if we already know the values of F(n – 1) and F(n – 2), we can simply add them without having to do the difficult steps in recreating them.</description>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence has a very strong connection to the Golden Ratio (φ, or Phi). φ is defined as (√5 + 1)/2, or approximately 1.618, and has lots of special properties. Ron Knott has a web page with over 300 Fibonacci and φ formulas. One of these is this direct formula: F(n) = round(φn/√5), where the rounding function does rounding to the nearest whole number.
This gives us a quite an efficient function:</description>

      <title>A Fibonacci A Day — Speedy Recursion</title>

      <guid>http://example.org/2013/03/18/a-fibonacci-a-day-speedy-recursion/</guid>
      <description>We have seen a very inefficient recursive version of the Fibonacci function, and an efficient iterative version. Is there an efficient recursive version?
Yes, in fact. Recall that the definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:
F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
What’s important to note is that the recursive step of the Fibonacci formula has two values that need to be accumulated. In the iterative version, the two temporary variables u and v are used to accumulate these values.</description>

      <description>Yesterday’s iterative version of the Fibonacci function is pretty speedy, especially compared to the recursive version. It calculates F(1000) in almost no time at all —
But. The result for F(1000) looks suspiciously low — and odd things happen if we use a different ‘high’ number, such as 100:
As it turns out, Scala’s Int and Long types are always signed, and do silent overflow. Once the number gets to a certain size, adding more will turn it ‘negative,’ and adding even more will eventually turn it positive, but (of course) the number is not correct.</description>

      <description>Yesterday’s Fibonacci function was recursive, but we saw that it was extremely inefficient. Recursive functions typically break down a problem into smaller pieces, solve the smaller pieces, then combine the results into a final result, where “breaking down” a problem is done by the recursive function calling itself on a smaller version of itself. But, as we saw, it’s possible that the number of times this may happen has to be controlled, or gross inefficiencies may occur; this sometimes gives recursion a bad name.</description>

      <description>Binging for “Fibonacci” and “Pi,” I came across this page: Pi and the Fibonacci Numbers, which has the nice formula
pi/4 = Σk=1arccot(F(2k+1)) summed to ∞, where F(n) is the _n_th Fibonacci number.
So, if you can compute the Fibonacci sequence, you can compute pi.</description>

      <description>The definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:
F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
This naturally leads to the following recursive function (here, as in all of the versions of A Fibonacci A Day, in Scala):
Note that because we are in the world of Scala, we have to declare that we are writing a function on Ints (that is, the Java/Scala representation of 32-bit signed numbers).</description>

      <description>The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers 0,1,1,2,3,5,8, … such that the nth number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers; and the the first two numbers are defined to be 0 and 1.
The Fibonacci function is a function which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. It’s kind of a famous function in computer science when people are first learning about recursive functions.</description>

Wordnik made the transition from Java to Scala before I joined them, and at least in my early days there, it seemed like the question was “Why Scala is a better Java.</description>

      <description>Slate has a review of a new book with the obscure title 10 PRINT CHR$ (205.5 + RND (1)); : GOTO 10, and this brings back such memories of typing in games from Basic Computer Games. The Basic program above prints (forever) as seen in this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9joBLOZVEo.
The magic here is that the computer is printing either a left or a right angled line character over and over; this looks like a maze.</description>

      <description>I’ve been working with the Dispatch library for Scala over the past couple of days. This is a library for “library for asynchronous HTTP interaction,” and it’s a wrapper for a similar library in Java. It’s been a little tricky to learn — the documentation could be better — and it seems useful to take down a few notes. First, though, it’s worth noting that you need to understand both the 0.</description>

      <description>I was wondering whether Scala had a parallel map function built in — it didn’t seem like it did.
Edit: But it does; see Erik Post’s comment below.
But, if you have a sequence of functions, for example:
val fns = List(() =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;goodbye&amp;quot;, () =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;good to see you&amp;quot;)
You can create a sequence of futures on it (thus, running them in parallel): import scala.actors.Futures._ val futures = fns.</description>

      <description>The tr program converts a string of characters into another string of characters, using a very simple rule system. The tr [A-Z] [a-z]. But this works for simple “ASCII” strings only. tr, at least on many systems, understands Unicode, and so the standard example fails for converting, say, Russian or Czech. But tr also understands character classes, so the standard example should be written tr [:upper:] [:lower:].

Today, I wanted to apply a list of filters to each item in a list, and return just those that pass each of the filters.
For example, given a range of integers, return just those that are divisible by 2 and by 3.
Let’s start by defining a boolean function divides:
Note that divides(2,_:Int) defines the (partial) function for division by 2.
So we can create our filters so:</description>

      <description>This is a followup to my post Computational lexicography on the cheap using Twitter, but more especially in response to Using off-the-shelf software for basic Twitter analysis.
The later article shows how to use database software (MySQL and its implementation of the SQL language) to do basic Twitter analysis. The ‘basic analysis’ includes counts by hashtag, timelines, and word clouds. They analyse about 475k tweets.
But here’s the thing: all their analyses can be done more simply with simple text files and pipes of Unix commands (as most eloquently demonstarted in Unix for Poets, by Ken Church).</description>

      <description>To implement a bloom filter, you need a bunch of hash functions. In naive implementations (and I’ve seen plenty), programmers pick out, say, five cryptographic hash functions. One problem with this is that the hash functions for bloom filters have different requirements than hash functions for cryptography–the latter tend to be more than is required for the former. What you want for bloom filters is something that’s very, very fast, while maintaining that basic desiderata for bloom filter hashing, uniform spread.</description>

      <description>Daniel Tunkaleng wrote an interesting blog post, “Retiring a Great Interview Problem” on an interview problem that he has, in the past, posed to interviewees, but which he has now retired, because someone posted the problem, and a solution, to an interview problem website. The problem is the segmentation problem (which he calls the word-break problem): given a string, segment it into reasonable words, if possible (for example, breaking “applepie” into “apple pie”).</description>

      <description>Here’s a problem I faced at work: determine the effective top level domain of a URI, using the data from the Public Suffix List, but not using any data structures read into memory (ie, a dynamically created hash table or even a static array). For example, the effective top level domain of “http://blog.entish.org” is “entish.org”, because it is a name one could register.
So, there are about 4000 “positive” rules and about 100 “negative” rules.</description>

      <description>As kind of a 10-finger exercise, I decided to write a small inverted index library in Ruby today, since I had the day off. This is just a few thoughts about what it was like to write tests for this code, which can be found at [https://github.com/willf/inverted_index_simple]1–not that I think you’ll write the next major search engine with this bit of code…
What struck me was that as I was writing unit tests, how many of the tests failed at first either because of undefined variables or dynamic typing problems.</description>

      <description>I’ve started teaching myself the Go programming language. I’m enjoying most aspects of it. It feels like a really modern C–that is, low level enough to be fast, but with lots of the bells and whistles one comes to expect in a modern programming language. It has lots of data types, an interesting alternative to object-oriented programming called interfaces, a reasonably-sized library, support for concurrency baked into the language, etc. The Go home page says it well:</description>

At the end of the first half, Rutter and Watson were tied. Lots of famous (and formerly famous) artificial intelligence researchers have weighed in on what this means for AI.</description>

      <description>[Note: I got bogged down on reading and reporting on the culturomics paper a little too closely, and this is a reboot.]
Peter Norvig, one of the co-authors of the culturomics paper and the director of research at Google, was also the co-author on another significant article with the suggestive title, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”. The invention of the term “culturomics” suggests a scientific programme for attacking questions of culture that stresses statistical models based on large amounts of data, a programme that has been very successful both academically and commercially for linguistics and artificial intelligence, to say nothing of the informatics approaches of genomics and proteomics upon which the term culturomics is based.</description>

The authors claim to have created a corpus of approximately four percent of all books ever published (over five billion books) and supplying time-stamped ngram data based on 500 billion words in seven languages, primarily English; from the 1500s until roughly the present, primarily more recently.</description>

      <description>I have 100,000 tweets which were sent on 25 March, 2010. Of these, 2,522 had a token which matched the pattern ‘tw_t[_]’, which collected forms like ‘tweeted’ and ‘twittered’ (and forms like ‘twentysomething’ and ‘twilight’). I scanned these and found twenty examples of relatively clear uses of a past tense form of ‘tweet’ or ‘twitter’ (as a verb); there were only 21 of these. Of these 21, 20 where ‘tweeted,’ and the other was ‘twittered’ (It was actually ‘twittrd’, but I take that to be a mispelling).</description>

      <description>Geoffrey K Pullum, in Tweet this, a blog post at the inestimable Language Log, discusses the syntax of the neologism tweet and engagingly writes:
 Twitter merely coined a verb meaning “send a message via Twitter”, but they didn’t specify what linguists call its subcategorization possibilities. They added the verb to the dictionary, but they didn’t specify its grammar. The verb tweet is gradually developing its own syntax according to what it means and what its users regard as its combinatory possibilities.</description>

If I were using a language with (compile-time) code macros (like Clojure, Scheme or Lisp), I’d prefer to write something like:
Measuring(&amp;quot;SomeFeature&amp;quot;){ComputeSomeFeature();} Measuring(&amp;quot;AnotherFeature&amp;quot;){ComputeAnotherFeature();}
But C# doesn’t have such a basic and useful thing, by design (bad design, I think, but still by design).
But C# does have first-class anonymous functions, so it’s possible to write methods that take one of these as a parameter.</description>

It’s a fun read in any case, including the origin story of hash tags.</description>

      <description>I’ve been playing with Microsoft Research’s ngram server in my spare time. I’ll write some more about this in time, I hope.
The API returns base 10 logs for its probabilities. Because the probabilities returned are so very low, it makes more sense to return a log probability. I could be wrong, but I think it’s normal practice to return base 2 logs, or base e logs for log probabilities. They are easily to convert from one base to another, so it doesn’t really matter.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed reading the Wikipedia page about its “lamest edit wars.” One of these edit wars was whether the article on what Americans call “aluminum” and what Brits call “aluminium” should have, as its fundamental title, “Aluminum,” or “Aluminium.” And, one of the arguments presented in favo(u)r of “Aluminum” was that more Google hits are available for the US spelling than the UK spelling. “Ghits” is notoriously unreliable (as are Bing hits and the other search engines), since the number of search results reported are subject to lots of factors, not of which is tied directly to actual number of documents returned.</description>

      <description>There are two questions: Is driving while talking on a cell phone safe? and Is it as dangerous as driving while drunk?
After reviewing some earlier studies, and looking at a new Virginia Tech study, I’d say the answer is a definite yes to the first question; and a probably not to the second question (not as dangerous as driving drunk, but maybe “only” 1/4 as dangerous.)
Details follow. All of the papers below are available online, and discuss (for the most part) their methodologies and metrics.</description>

This is similar in spirit to Tim Bray’s ‘wide finder’ project, and I’ve leveraged his popularity to find a useful utility created by Preston l. Bannister called “feed-workers” that implements the ‘map’ part of map-reduce (but over a large file, rather than a large set of files).</description>

 How many unique ways are there to acquire at least 270 electoral votes without any excess? I figured it would be a ‘large’ number, but I was surprised at the actual total: 51,199,463,116,367 (or, fifty-one trillion and change). about 2.3% of all possible combinations (This exact number is based on the simplifying assumption of treating Maine and Nevada as giving up their electoral votes in the same way as all the other states).</description>

In a blog post, “Medicine and Statistics Don’t Mix,” Levitt tells the story of friends of his who spent $5,000 on Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) — a test for genetic viability of embryos — during fertility treatment. The test came back positive for the possibility of birth defects.</description>

 OpenDMAP advances the performance standards for extracting protein-protein interaction predications from the full texts of biomedical research articles. Furthermore, this level of performance appears to generalize to other information extraction tasks, including extracting information about predicates of more than two arguments.</description>

Hah! If I’d written this in Lisp, it would be the much simpler:

 Last week I left a note on Laura’s desk It said I love you signed anonymous friend Turns out she’s smarter than I thought she was She knows I wrote it, now the whole class does too … But I know that I’ll forget the look of pity in her face When I’m living in my solar dome on a platform in space.</description>

      <description>Today’s Earth and Sky discusses a few topics mildly dear to my lunatic heart. They discuss blue moons and time zones.
 When there’s a second full moon of a calendar month, it’s come to be called a Blue Moon. I like the careful use of “it’s come to be called,” since it is a bit controversial what “blue moon” means, and where it comes from. But I think they’re right that “the second full moon of a calendar month” is the most common meaning of “blue moon” these days.</description>

Daughter and wife looked slightly alarmed, and dear wife asked if there were any chance that I was working myself out of a job. I said I didn’t think there was much chance that the coming robot wars were about to begin. Getting back to my computer later, I saw this on the console:</description>

Kelly has been a friend of Bess’s since high school, and Susan Ford Clark, Kelly’s wife, shared an apartment with Bess their senior year–in fact, Kelly and Susan, and Bess and I, were married on the same day in the same church (at different times).</description>

The chart above are the results from the Protein-Protein Interaction Task.
My colleague at Powerset, Jim Firby and I worked on some of the semantic parsing technology used by the Colorado group.</description>

      <description>ITunes 7.0.x for the Mac, at least, is very, very buggy. Here are instructions for reverting to iTunes 6.0.5, based on instructions found in various places on the web. ITunes 7.0.x hasn’t worked for me at all for more than 10 minutes since I installed it. The 7.0.1 release did not fix any of the problems that I was having. Note that these instructions will lose any changes you’ve made since upgrading to iTunes 7.</description>

      <description>It’s looking as if Neil Armstrong did say “One small step for a man…” rather than “One small step for man…”; this is what he has always maintained as his intent (Houston Chronicle story; via /.).
Perhaps someday historians will correct it again to “That’s one small step for a man; one giant leap for humanity.”
Update: I should have been a bit more skeptical, I think. At least taken a closer look at the data, which David Beaver has now done in a post on Language Log.</description>

      <description>With the demotion of Pluto to a dwarf planet, there are reports that a new mnemonic is required to recall the order of the nine–er, wait, only eight–planets. In fact, Jason Kottke sponsored a mnemonics contest. Kottke is one of the first generation bloggers, along Meg Hourihan. They were the subject of a New Yorker article early on, as well as an update recently when they got married. Kottke doesn’t write very much about himself, though, so I was pretty sure my entry wouldn’t win, but I still like it very much:</description>

Two little things of note that will make me want to buy it: A new speech synthesis voice, Alex, that sounds quite good. And boolean operators in Spotlight, the full-text searching tool; plus search on file attributes. The later should have already been in Spotlight, in my humble opinion, but that’s one way Apple keeps getting my money…</description>

I went to the Nutch meeting at the Rite-Spot Cafe (a delightfully greasy spoon not far from my house, actually), and sat around a loud, long table with (fellow) geeks talking about search and map-reduce and clusters and regression testing and spidering. The noise level became VERY LOUD and so I left to come home and sleep (though I’m writing this instead).</description>

      <description>Yahoo! has announced a new rev of the Yahoo! User Interface library. I’ve already thought of an innovative use for the windowing controls, which must remain sekrit for now. Safari died a spectacular death when testing out the AutoComplete feature, though. I guess that’s one reason they’re still calling it a beta test. I really wish I’d had this library available when I did the NASA mission planning interface.</description>

This was probably an online poll conducted by YouGov by Privilege Insurance, a UK company. It’s hard to say whether there’s any chance of the survey being accurate, since no details are given in the Computerworld story (which might just be a Reuters reprint), and the study isn’t mentioned, as far as I can tell, on Priviledge’s website.</description>

 You can see other pieces of the future [in addition to audio search and automatic translation] emerging as well. In-Q-Tel has a variety of investments in sensor related technology, including network architectures, next generation protein and gene chips, and fundamental nanotechnology fabrication techniques, with wide applicability to chemical and biological threats.

      <description>As part of the Autonomous Rotorcraft Project, I was the main developer on the Mission Planner Interface (MPI). It’s a browser-based tool (requiring Firefox 1.5, Safari, or the latest Opera beta) that allows definition of observation targets that are sent off to the mission planner, which then creates a plan to visit all of the targets and then controls the heliocopter as it carries out the mission. One cool technical trick is that the MPI uses the new-fangled ‘Ajax’ ideas to talk to the plan execution system (well, talks to a server that talks to the system) so that, for example, the position of the helicopter is shown on the map, and to provide pan-and-zoom features (a la Google Maps).</description>

      <description>We demo’d the Autonomous Rotocraft Project at Moffett Field today–not just any demo, but the “5 year demo,” the capstone of the project. I was a bit nervous, since I had a major role to play in the demo script, but hadn’t actually been able to practice with the real helicopter. There was a tricky bit where I had to induce a simulated ‘communication fault,’ so the helicopter could respond in a useful way–but it had to be done at just the right time; that is, where a communication fault could occur and be successfully taken care of.</description>

      <description>New human virus linked to obesity in animals:
 “The nearly simultaneous increase in the prevalence of obesity in most countries of the world is difficult to explain by changes in food intake and exercise alone, and suggests that adenoviruses could have contributed,” the authors state.“The role of adenoviruses in the worldwide epidemic of obesity is a critical question that demands additional research.” </description>

      <description>We have a big demo next week that requires at least one rain-free morning on Tuesday or Wednesday, so I’ve been checking the weather forecasts. One thing I’ve learned is that the National Weather Service publishes ‘forecast discussions.’ These give the rationale for the government’s weather forecasts. For example, from today:
 After Sunday…the forecast becomes much less clear. Over the past several days…there has been significant variation in solutions both run-to-run of the same model and between the different longer-range models.</description>

      <description>Guy Steele in DDJ, Thoughts on Language Design: discusses going beyond the structured programming constructs of loops, if-then-else, and sequential operation:
 What might a language look like in which parallelism is the default? How about data-parallel languages, in which you operate, at least conceptually, on all the elements of an array at the same time? These go back to APL in the 1960s, and there was a revival of interest in the 1980s when data-parallel computer architectures were in vogue.</description>

 “I have an audiologist friend at Wichita State University who actually pulls off earphones of students he sees and asks, in the interest of science, if he could measure the output of the signal going into their heads,” Garstecki said. Often he finds students listening at 110 to 120 decibels. “That’s a sound level equivalent to measures that are made at rock concerts,” said Garstecki.</description>

 Not necessarily, according to Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Richard Skinner. According to his written testimony, one UAV requires a crew of up to 20 support personnel. In fact, the operating cost is more than double that of a manned aircraft.

I remember seeing 100! for the first time:
93,­326,­215,­443,­944,­152,­681,­699,­238,­856,­266,­700,­490,­715,­968,­264,­381,­621,­468,­592,­963,­895,­217,­599,­993,­229,­915,­608,­941,­463,­976,­156,­518,­286,­253,­697,­920,­827,­223,­758,­251,­185,­210,­916,­864,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000,­000
I wondered where all those (24) zeroes came from, but I never took the time to figure it out.
Nor did I have time to figure it out as I read Tim’s post, but I did have a couple of minutes to write a Lisp program to compute n!</description>

 Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may [a machine] not become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand? For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.</description>

      <description>Is this a potential solution to the production of hydrogen-fueled cars? Danish Researchers Reveal New Hydrogen Storage Technology. What are the possible pollution side-effects?
 In the process described in the article, ammonia (NH3) is produced as an intermediate step. The biggest challenge of this technology is creating a safe fuel tank that can hold ammonia, which can be harmful or fatal to people and animals in the vehicle, because: NH3 is immediately toxic at 500 ppm, NH3 reacts with water, producing ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), producing a lot of heat (‘exothermic reaction’) which could (say) blow up the car, NH3 is very cold when it is vaporized.</description>

 Human-centered design has become such a dominant theme in design that it is now accepted by interface and application designers automatically, without thought, let alone criticism. That’s a dangerous state—when things are treated as accepted wisdom. The purpose of this essay is to provoke thought, discussion, and reconsideration of some of the fundamental principles of human-centered design.</description>

      <description>600 barrels of loot found on Crusoe island
 This most recent announcement, however, deserves greater credence because of the equipment used by the treasure hunters: a mini robot that can scan 50 metres deep into the earth. The robot, dubbed “Arturito”, was invented by Chileans and over the past year has grabbed headlines by breaking some of the country’s biggest criminal mysteries.

      <description>I’ve got to believe that something like the new-style USB drive will become increasingly important, with monitors and cpus staying behind on desktops. I already have a 1 Gb USB drive, which is almost enough to carry my work to California and back; I also have a 120 Gb firewire drive that has a bootable copy of my main drive, so, in theory, I don’t need to even bring my laptop at all.</description>

      <description>More on those drones. John Wiseman writes this:
 The 10 Evolution mini-UAVs flying out of the New Orleans Naval Air Station and “[assessing] damage to oil and gas distribution, dikes, berms and other aspects of the region’s infrastructure” are apparently part of the biggest civilian UAV deployment ever.

      <description>I wanted to have a bunch of images, all lined up in a horizontal row, but within a fixed size element (like above). This is mostly a note to myself so I can ‘remember’ this the next time I need it…
Here are the CSS style declarations:
Note that the IMG size is the same as the line-height of the enclosing DIV; which is just a bit less than the DIV height (to allow for the scroll bar).</description>

      <description>Jean Véronis got slashdotted on the index size story.
The NCSA is somewhat disclaiming the index size study published on the NCSA website, and the study has been revised somewhat. Véronis is keeping up: his latest post, Technologies du Langage: Yahoo: Missing pages? (4), includes the original stronger disclaimer, and discusses why the revised study is still flawed.
 In conclusion, this new study is just as biaised as the previous one.</description>

On the one hand, they examined actual results returned from the search engines; on the other, they investigated only English searches. The later makes it very unlikely to report a comparison fairly.
Jean Véronis has written a series of posts examining reported results from Google, Yahoo and MSN. One of the latest looks at the claim that Yahoo is indexing 19 billion pages.</description>

      <description>More than mirror neurons? A summary of an study reported in Neuron:
 Most importantly, the study affirms that there really isn’t a single fundamental visual representation in the brain — the representation used to recognize an object is not the same as the representation used to pick up that object. Because of the different functions of these tasks, this probably doesn’t sound too surprising but, to me, it is surprising!</description>

      <description>So, I’m doing what I thought would be a small browser-based project (kindof ‘Ajaxy’), but it turns out to be taking longer than I thought it would. Things are better than there were when I last did heavy web-dev work, especially considering that I am not worrying about being compatible with anything other than the latest FIrefox or Safari releases. But I’m writing a lot of Javascript, and it feels a bit like going back to the mid-80s, and I’m having to remember certain caveats that I haven’t had to thing about in a long time.</description>

 A Natural Language Voice-Activation feature works by understanding fluent natural language instead of command keywords like ‘RADIO…ON’. For example, ‘TURN UP THE RADIO’ or ‘MAKE THE MUSIC LOUDER’ would all have the same effect. How likely would you be to purchase this feature on your next vehicle at a cost of $300?

I was surprised that the conference lasted for four days. But it made more sense once I arrived: I think people who like Lisp feel somewhat embattled, and this conference is an opportunity to lick wounds and recuperate and not feel the need to justify the use of a nearly 50-year old language.</description>

      <description>Michael Hannemann sent me a pointer to a New Scientist article about the newest version of the AERCam, a spherical space camera for inspection tasks.
Speaking of ex-co-workers, here’s a photo of John Wiseman and me at the International Lisp Conference (ILC2005). John is the cool looking guy with the ‘burns. I’m the nose on the right.</description>

      <description>I’m getting hundreds of spam emails in German today — it looks like this started in general about a year ago. I’m surprised the spam filter in Gmail isn’t catching them.
They pretty much all start ‘Lese sebst:’ followed by a URL.
Anyone else getting these suddenly?
Update I guess it is a worldwide attack, according to the Beeb.</description>

      <description>U.S. security devices at ports to be replaced (via robotwisdom).
 After spending more than $4.5 billion on screening devices to monitor ports, borders, airports, mail and the air, the U.S. government is moving to replace or alter much of the antiterrorism equipment, concluding that it is ineffective, unreliable or too expensive to operate.

 The impossibility of penetrating the divine scheme of the universe does not, however, dissuade us from planning human schemes, even though we know they must be provisional.

      <description>While poking around as I created my previous post, I discovered that the LaTeX sources for printing algorithms in the style used in Introduction to Algorithms is available from Thomas H. Cormen’s website. Below are examples of an insertion sort algorithm typeset using Cormen’s style, and the same algorithm typeset using the standard “algorithm” package. Which do you like better?

      <description>I had a small ‘ah-hah’ experience while reading Implementing sets efficiently in a functional language. Descriptions of binary tree sorting/searching algorithms, such as the excellent Introduction to Algorithms, state that items to be sorted have to be strictly ordered, which means you can’t have duplicates in the tree. But this is easily solved by storing duplicates together in the same binary tree node. “The implementing sets” article suggests adding a ‘count’ field to the node, which marks how many copies are in the node.</description>

      <description>As promised, a quick test of compressing the US Constitution to compare it to the compression rates seen by Jean Véronis for the European constitution.
It’s interesting to note that the compression ratio went down with the addition of the Bill of Rights. Not surprisingly, the other amendments have the biggest compression ratio There are a number of copies of “The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.</description>

      <description>Jean Véronis describes an informal experiment in compressing different texts, including the European constitution. (Original in French, Auto-translated to English). He notes that normally, French texts compress at about 60-65% of the original, but the EU constitution compresses at about 75%. He puts this down to “jargon, puffery, redundancy…” in the constitution. I wonder what the US Constitution is (before and after any admendments added after the Bill of Rights). To be determined…</description>

So I posted this note:
A group of us are pretty upset that the PLT Scheme Team has announced plans to drop LAMBDA from PLT Scheme v300.
We agree that dropping FILTER and MAP is a good idea, although for different reasons. We think that (filter P S) is almost always written more clearly as:</description>

      <description>Jean Veronis has interesting post about the use of abbreviations in an ancient Christian text. He points out that later (medieval) texts had a much higher use of abbreviations, and suggests that perhaps the use of translations for Lord, Jesus, etc., were to mark “membership in a tribe” in addition to compression.
 Ne retrouve-t-on pas là le double besoin qui se fait sentir dans l’écriture “texto” : gagner de la place, sans doute, mais aussi marquer son appartenance à une tribu, à un groupe à part ?</description>

      <description>Yet Another Cell Phone Distraction Study. Study size: 20. Findings: talking on a cell phone is distracting; young people react with the slowness of older/drunken people; old people react with the slowness of slightly older people. Six of the 20 rear-ended the (simulated) pace car (four while talking on a cell phone).
 “If you put a 20-year-old driver behind the wheel with a cell phone, their reaction times are the same as a 70-year-old driver who is not using a cell phone.</description>

We’re fairly confident of her language skills (today she asked me what ‘subcutaneous meant), but she’s fairly math adverse, so Bess asked me to tutor her a little. It’s hard to know how to prepare a 12 year old for the math section of the SATs, but today we spent about an hour discussing odds and percentages.</description>

In fact, I decided I would just write out addresses in an address book.
In the end, though, I had a brainstorm.</description>

      <description>A followup on post about searching for ‘vice presidential debate’, which Tim commented on.
First of all, I really wasn’t complaining about (say) Yahoo Search’s lack of results from the 2004 debates–it was just odd and a bit disorienting to be thrown back to 2000. I even clicked on an audio stream of the debate and got a ‘this stream is no longer available’ error message–it was then that I realized this was a link for the 2000 Lieberman-Cheney debate.</description>

      <description>It’s interesting that as I’ve searched for sources for the vice presidential debates tonight, I’m getting a lot of hits from the debates (both presidential and vice presidential) from 2000. I guess this has to do with “page rank,” but it seems odd. This CNN link, for example, was the fifth link on Google for ‘vice presidential debate. Four out of the top five results for ‘vice presidential debate’ from the beta search engine snap, as well as Yahoo search were from the 2000 election.</description>

      <description>According to Bruce Schneier, the Bush adminstration wants to put RFID tags in our passports.
 Unfortunately, there is only one possible reason: The administration wants surreptitious access [to the broadcast information on the passports] themselves. It wants to be able to identify people in crowds. It wants to surreptitiously pick out the Americans, and pick out the foreigners. It wants to do the very thing that it insists, despite demonstrations to the contrary, can’t be done.</description>
