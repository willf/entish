      I was writing some Scala code which had a long series of somewhat complicated and expensive calculations to make, and in many cases I wanted to log the intermediate calculations. The first version of this code was quite complicated looking, because the calculations of the intermediate values and the logging statements were all intermixed.
But then I realized that I could create a separate object which maintained the state, and which performed the calculations, too.

Even more interesting is that a Fibonacci function which runs in O(lg(n)) steps is presented — that is, it takes about lg(n) steps to compute the _n_th Fibonacci number, instead of n steps.

      We are now confident that the fast recursive version is the best of the algorithms we have explored — it is fast, and can handle large values of the Fibonacci function.
I haven’t been happy, though, with returning a negative -1 when the function is called with a negative number — this feels like a kind of silent error we were trying to avoid in going to BigInts. Fortunately, it turns out that there is a natural extension of the Fibonacci sequence to negative numbers.

      Although the iterative recursive version is stateless, it looks different from the standard mathematical definition. The recursive version is a very close mapping, but it’s extremely inefficient. One way to overcome the inefficiencies is to dynamically record (or memoize) previous calculations of F(n). The idea is simple — if we already know the values of F(n – 1) and F(n – 2), we can simply add them without having to do the difficult steps in recreating them.

      The Fibonacci sequence has a very strong connection to the Golden Ratio (φ, or Phi). φ is defined as (√5 + 1)/2, or approximately 1.618, and has lots of special properties. Ron Knott has a web page with over 300 Fibonacci and φ formulas. One of these is this direct formula: F(n) = round(φn/√5), where the rounding function does rounding to the nearest whole number.
This gives us a quite an efficient function:

      We have seen a very inefficient recursive version of the Fibonacci function, and an efficient iterative version. Is there an efficient recursive version?
Yes, in fact. Recall that the definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:
F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
What’s important to note is that the recursive step of the Fibonacci formula has two values that need to be accumulated. In the iterative version, the two temporary variables u and v are used to accumulate these values.

      Yesterday’s iterative version of the Fibonacci function is pretty speedy, especially compared to the recursive version. It calculates F(1000) in almost no time at all —
But. The result for F(1000) looks suspiciously low — and odd things happen if we use a different ‘high’ number, such as 100:
As it turns out, Scala’s Int and Long types are always signed, and do silent overflow. Once the number gets to a certain size, adding more will turn it ‘negative,’ and adding even more will eventually turn it positive, but (of course) the number is not correct.

      Yesterday’s Fibonacci function was recursive, but we saw that it was extremely inefficient. Recursive functions typically break down a problem into smaller pieces, solve the smaller pieces, then combine the results into a final result, where “breaking down” a problem is done by the recursive function calling itself on a smaller version of itself. But, as we saw, it’s possible that the number of times this may happen has to be controlled, or gross inefficiencies may occur; this sometimes gives recursion a bad name.

But, if you have a sequence of functions, for example:

You can create a sequence of futures on it (thus, running them in parallel): import scala.actors.Futures._ val futures = fns.

      Yesterday, I was writing some code that needed to (1) go over a collection of stored database objects, conditionally convert some of these to another version of themselves, and filter out some of them. For some reason, I got myself tripped up on some very basic things, and so here are some notes for myself and perhaps for others. (There were some other things going on, for one, support website pagination, but I won’t discuss that here).

      A random Scala note.
Today, I wanted to apply a list of filters to each item in a list, and return just those that pass each of the filters.
For example, given a range of integers, return just those that are divisible by 2 and by 3.
Let’s start by defining a boolean function divides:
Note that divides(2,_:Int) defines the (partial) function for division by 2.
So we can create our filters so:
