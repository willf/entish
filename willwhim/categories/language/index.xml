      <title>Word vectors: Machine learning oversimplified</title>

      <description>Word vectors have become increasingly important in as features in machine learning models for natural language processing. The idea is to represent a word in some multidimensional space (the vector) in which words which are “similar” are similar in that space. Typically, one hopes that word vectors will provide some kind of semantic similarity. A typical party trick is to use word vectors to solve word analogy problems; e.g., king is to queen as man is to ?</description>

      <title>How to to named entity recognition: machine learning oversimplified</title>

      <description>What is Named Entity Recognition? Named Entity Recognition (or NER) is the task of finding all the names of things in a text. For example, in the sentence “Jimi Hendrix played ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ at Woodstock,” NER, correctly done, would find the references to “Jimi Hendrix,” “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and “Woodstock.” Note that NER should also extract names it has never previously seen; for example, in the sentence “Johannes von Smetly is the protagonist in Willard Smith’s new novel”, an NER system should extract “Johannes von Smetly” as a name, even if it it doesn’t appear in any standard name list.</description>

      <title>When did Constantinople become Istanbul?</title>

      <description>This interesting article on using Google Ngram data to estimate when new names for world cities overtook their names (for example, “Beijing” instead of “Peking”) makes the following claim:
 “Istanbul” is still less commonthan “Constantinople” more than five hundred years after the the city fell to the Muslims.But I think this is either a bit tongue-in-cheek, or misinformed. Of course, the Ngram data records books discussing any period of history, and I suspect that more is written about historic Constantinople than modern Istanbul.</description>

      <description>There is a controversy over “Computational linguistics and literary scholarship.” A paper published at the Association for Computational Linguistics David Bamman, Brendan O’Connor, &amp;amp; Noah A. Smith, “Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters“) has come under criticims by Hannah Alpert-Abrams with Dan Garrette, “Some thoughts on the relationship between computational linguistics and literary scholarship“. The primary criticism has been that the ACL paper fails to cite any literary scholarship past the middle of the last century.</description>

      <description>Dearest creature in creation, Study English pronunciation. It’s more regular in its core Than pundits, who focus on its more Erratic ways, would have you believe. Perhaps they simply cannot conceive Of any system not based in Latin— They would choose, I suppose, to flatten All writing to “one form, one sound” But, really, regularities abound. Consider, how we pronounce the plural Form of words; Imagine the neural Work of reading “dogs” and “cats.</description>

      <description>This is a followup to my post Computational lexicography on the cheap using Twitter, but more especially in response to Using off-the-shelf software for basic Twitter analysis.
The later article shows how to use database software (MySQL and its implementation of the SQL language) to do basic Twitter analysis. The ‘basic analysis’ includes counts by hashtag, timelines, and word clouds. They analyse about 475k tweets.
But here’s the thing: all their analyses can be done more simply with simple text files and pipes of Unix commands (as most eloquently demonstarted in Unix for Poets, by Ken Church).</description>

      <title>On “culturomics”</title>

      <description>[Note: I got bogged down on reading and reporting on the culturomics paper a little too closely, and this is a reboot.]
Peter Norvig, one of the co-authors of the culturomics paper and the director of research at Google, was also the co-author on another significant article with the suggestive title, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”. The invention of the term “culturomics” suggests a scientific programme for attacking questions of culture that stresses statistical models based on large amounts of data, a programme that has been very successful both academically and commercially for linguistics and artificial intelligence, to say nothing of the informatics approaches of genomics and proteomics upon which the term culturomics is based.</description>

      <description>I’ve now had a chance to read the Science Express article describing “culturomics,” that is, the “Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books,” recently published by researchers at Google and several high-profile academic and commercial institutions. The authors claim to have created a corpus of approximately four percent of all books ever published (over five billion books) and supplying time-stamped ngram data based on 500 billion words in seven languages, primarily English; from the 1500s until roughly the present, primarily more recently.</description>

      <description>It was fun to review the world’s longest logogol (or palindrome) on Peter Norvig’s website today. A logogol is a word or phrase that has the same letters going forwards or going backwards. I think it’s cool that “logogol” is itself a logogol.</description>

      <description>Like tweet, text follows the pattern of verbs called “verbs of instruments of communication” in Beth Levin’s book, English Verb Classes and Alterations: A Preliminary Investigation. In Levin’s inventory, these verbs include
 cable e-mail fax modem netmail phone radio relay satellite sign semaphore signal telecast telegraph telephone telex wire wireless
 As I did for tweet, I downloaded tweets from Twitter; I just looked for occurrences of ‘texted. Not surprisingly, it was harder to find examples of texted than tweet[ed], but I did find a fair number of examples in a short time.</description>

      <description>We all hate clichés. As this article on avoiding clichés from the Oxford Dictionaries says, they’re not always possible to avoid.
Here are some clichés used in the article’s text. These are not examples they give, but clichés they use in the body text:
 Once you’ve spotted a cliché… they’ve lost their impact [they’ve] become stale Some people just tune out make a point [they may miss the point that you’re trying to make] use [something] as a starting point indispensable advice  At least they didn’t say “avoid clichés like the plague,” the clichéd anti-cliché joke.</description>

      <description>I have 100,000 tweets which were sent on 25 March, 2010. Of these, 2,522 had a token which matched the pattern ‘tw_t[_]’, which collected forms like ‘tweeted’ and ‘twittered’ (and forms like ‘twentysomething’ and ‘twilight’). I scanned these and found twenty examples of relatively clear uses of a past tense form of ‘tweet’ or ‘twitter’ (as a verb); there were only 21 of these. Of these 21, 20 where ‘tweeted,’ and the other was ‘twittered’ (It was actually ‘twittrd’, but I take that to be a mispelling).</description>

      <description>Geoffrey K Pullum, in Tweet this, a blog post at the inestimable Language Log, discusses the syntax of the neologism tweet and engagingly writes:
 Twitter merely coined a verb meaning “send a message via Twitter”, but they didn’t specify what linguists call its subcategorization possibilities. They added the verb to the dictionary, but they didn’t specify its grammar. The verb tweet is gradually developing its own syntax according to what it means and what its users regard as its combinatory possibilities.</description>

This is simple to do with a bash command line, perl, Ruby, the Tweetstream gem, and a spreadsheet program (or just plain old grep).
To download 10,000 tweets containing “tweet,” “tweets”, or “tweeting” and save them in a file called “tweet.</description>

Well, with the Bing Ngram data, we can provide more exact figures which don’t depend on all of the choice and ranking decisions made by a search engine to include or not a page in a result, and (in particular) the estimate of the number of pages on which the term appears.</description>

      <description>I noticed that the expression “avoid like the plaque” showing up in some search results I was doing. This is “plaque” with-a-queue, not “plague”-with-a-gee. This seems like an odd misspelling to me, and I was curious how often this occurs. The Bing Ngram data gives us the tools: given “avoid like the”, the word “plague” occurs 98.68% of the time (in the web body data). The word “plaque” is the second most common word, occurring 0.</description>

Twitter hashtags have been used for some time to tag tweets according to users’ choice and whimsy. Coincidentally, my daytime boss has just conducted an interview with William Morgan–formerly of Powerset, but now at Twitter–about hash tags, in case you want to come up to speed on what they are. It’s a fun read in any case, including the origin story of hash tags.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed reading the Wikipedia page about its “lamest edit wars.” One of these edit wars was whether the article on what Americans call “aluminum” and what Brits call “aluminium” should have, as its fundamental title, “Aluminum,” or “Aluminium.” And, one of the arguments presented in favo(u)r of “Aluminum” was that more Google hits are available for the US spelling than the UK spelling. “Ghits” is notoriously unreliable (as are Bing hits and the other search engines), since the number of search results reported are subject to lots of factors, not of which is tied directly to actual number of documents returned.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I wrote about whether there was evidence that people tend to “buy a home and sell a house,” and used Google’s n-gram data (based on web documents) to suggest this wasn’t the case. I happened to come across this post today, and wondered whether some of the query streams I have access to now might say something to this. I looked at our frequently “sell” or “buy” co-occur with “house” or “home” in a stream of about 36 million queries.</description>

Every one has been put in an embarrassing position by ignorance of the status of some woman. To call a maiden Mrs is only a shade worse than to insult a matron with the inferior title Miss. Yet it is not always easy to know the facts. When an author puts on the title page of a book Marion Smith, it is not even possible to be certain of the sex of the writer, and it is decidedly awkward for a reviewer to repeat the name in full over and over again.</description>

      <description>It has often been noted that English is deficient because it lacks a third-person pronoun that can refer to any person, without respect to sexual gender. Although some claim that “he” can refer to anyone in sentences like (1), most linguists agree that maleness is much more salient in these cases than a generic sense.
(1) Everyone should do his own work.
There are at least six common solutions proposed:</description>

      <description>Geoffrey K. Pullum’s tirade about the 50th anniversary of William Strunk’s_The Elements of Style_ as edited by E.B. White is deliciously correct.

      <description>I got discussing the idea of Gemütlichkeit with a friend today–actually the Danish expression “hygge”–but I was connecting it to Gemütlichkeit–and I made the claim that “homely” used to mean something like gemütlich.
And so it seems: the OED reports several senses of “homely” with gemütlich connotations. For example, “Become as one of the household; familiar, intimate; at home with”, now rare or obsolete. The first citation is from 865 ad.</description>

Arnold Zwicky has a post at Language Log on “home” vs. “house” in (American) English, citing (among other things) the commentators in the Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage saying:
 A final note on home ownership: MWDEU reports that “a number of commentators have remarked on the tendency to buy a home and sell a house”. I was curious to see whether this ‘tendency’ was real, so I checked the Google 3-gram data (see announcement).</description>

I came across an earlier example from 1793, in Elder John Leland’s “The history of Jack Nips”:
 Like other boys, I wished to be in fashion, and as the Presbyterians were the most fashionable, I applied myself to the study of their books, but was not a little puzzled to reconcile their writings with my boyish thoughts.</description>

      <description>America the Beautiful has interesting linguistic properties. In particular, it uses verbs in the subjunctive mood, which is quite unusual in modern English, except in fixed expressions (such as “God forbid.”). The subjunctive is usually used to describe a condition that doesn’t exist, or a condition that one wishes to exist, such as “if I were a rich man.”
The interesting thing about the subjunctive in English is that it often indistinguishable from the simple past tense or a request/command form.</description>

 OpenDMAP advances the performance standards for extracting protein-protein interaction predications from the full texts of biomedical research articles. Furthermore, this level of performance appears to generalize to other information extraction tasks, including extracting information about predicates of more than two arguments.</description>

      <description>From ‘In pursuit of the G-d shot‘:
 Millions of people probably get great coffee every morning with a standard home machine and ground coffee from a supermarket. I was starting to worry that, with a process that has as many variables as pulling an espresso, once you’re daft enough to go off piste, things get monumentally messy in a way only explicable with chaos theory. To go off piste is to go off the trail (in cross-country skiing, for example), to do something non-standard.</description>

 You know, just between you and me, I sometimes worry that there is a naive view loose out there — most students come to linguistics believing it, and there appear to be some professional linguists who regard it as central and explanatory — that language has something to do with purposes of efficiently conveying information from a speaker to a hearer. What a load of nonsense.</description>

      <description>There must be an antonym for ‘hype.’ To hype something is to engage in hyperbole about it: Apple products have generated their share of hype. (For example: Steve Jobs said, “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”) I don’t mean ‘anti-hype’ in the sense of telling the approximate truth about something, desengaño or dis-illusionment. But after the IPhone announcement, Steve Ballmer said, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.</description>

      <description> The uniqueness and immense pragmatic convenience of proper names in our language lie precisely in the fact that they enable us to refer publicly to objects without being forced to raise issues and come to agreement on what descriptive characteristics exactly constitute the identity of the object. They function not as descriptions, but as pegs on which to hang descriptions (Searle).

      <description>On the Fasola discussions list (a list for discussions about the history and practice of shape note singing), I wrote the following paragraph about a crooked ‘singing master’ (that is, a 18th or 19th century singing school teacher):
 On the other hand, I did recently read (in the Historic Missouri Newspaper Project online archives) a warning advertisement for one singing master who was a shyster and who absconded with funds collected for the school and for printing flyers, etc.</description>

      <description>I used the term ‘shyster’ in a post on a mail list, and someone thought it derogatory. Looking into it, I agree; I apologized and will not use it in the future. Others want to discuss whether it is or not derogatory; here’s a place to discuss this.

      <description>Why are you reading this, when you should be reading Natalia’s ball-peen hammer to the head?
One of the many things that it takes for a computer to “understand” text (as we are trying to do at Powerset) is for it recognize names and what they refer to. So for example, in the sentence “Maid Marian is the female companion to the legendary figure Robin Hood.”, a computer needs to see the names Maid Marian and Robin Hood are present, and have some kind of internal representation of Ms.</description>

      <description>St. Basil, who lived from around 330-379 CE, is one of the “three hierarchs” of the Orthodox Church. I’ve just finished reading (in a translation by RJ Deferrai), an excellent essay On the distinction between ousia and hypostasis. In this letter, he writes very clearly about the Christian view of God as Triune, in particular explaining the meaning of the technical terms ousia (abstract being) and hypostasis (individual being).
It’s good as a piece of theology, but it’s also interesting as clear technical writing.</description>

      <description>Mark Liberman, in his usual engaging way, discusses “the tangled history of a mangled maxim” at Language Log.
It was prompted by a statement in Bush’s State of the Union address: “Our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: To whom much is given, much is required,” which should be (to be parsable) something like “To whom much is given, of them much is required.”
Liberman notes that this eventually goes back to the New Testament, specifically Luke 12:48, which, in King James’s Engish, is: “For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required.</description>

Although my mama warned me never to discuss language usage in public forums, let me weigh in here a bit …
Here is the line from “On the swiftness of Time” posted by Jesse Pearlman Karlsberg:
Unthinking man! remember this, Thou, &#39;midst thy sublunary bliss, Must groan, and gasp, and die!  I think what is ‘archaic’ (that is, no longer in common use) about the use of midst here is its use as a preposition.</description>

      <description>With the demotion of Pluto to a dwarf planet, there are reports that a new mnemonic is required to recall the order of the nine–er, wait, only eight–planets. In fact, Jason Kottke sponsored a mnemonics contest. Kottke is one of the first generation bloggers, along Meg Hourihan. They were the subject of a New Yorker article early on, as well as an update recently when they got married. Kottke doesn’t write very much about himself, though, so I was pretty sure my entry wouldn’t win, but I still like it very much:</description>

      <description>A definition from the electronic dictionary program that comes with the Macintosh (based the New Oxford American English Dictionary):
 faith-based (adjective): affiliated with or based on religion or a religious group : a faith-based plan that bilked investors out of millions. USAGE The preponderance of usage for this term today connects it with institutions and programs that are affiliated with an organized religion, and with President George W. Bush’s faith-based initiative, which enables religious institutions doing social work to receive government funding.</description>

      <description>Mark Liberman (to whom I emailed about Zonker’s use of ‘my brave‘), wrote about ‘My adjective‘ on Language Log. As usual, he has interesting things to say. He points out that
 One small issue is that second-person forms like “your idiotic” are homophonous with the corresponding clausal forms “you’re idiotic” etc. But that sort of ambiguity between innovation and conservatism may be an advantage.
 I began to wonder whether complex adjectival phrases will eventually be allowed in “My ___” forms.</description>

      <description>The word of the day is subreption.
I asked the following question on the Linguist List:
 Words like ‘to dial’ and ‘key’ and ‘album’ take on a shifted meaning as the underlying technology changes. Wordnet, for example, still defines ‘to dial’ as something like ‘to enter a telephone number using a dial.’ Of course, most dialing now occurs via push-buttons. Similarly, keys are now often made of a plastic card (or are completely virtual), and an ‘album’ can be a CD.</description>

 La grammaire, avec son mélange de règle logique et d’usage arbitraire, propose au jeune esprit un avant-goût de ce que lui offriront plus tard les sciences de la conduite humaine, le droit ou la morale, tous les systèmes où l’homme a codifié son expérience instinctive. (Marguerite Yourcenar, Mémoires d’Hadrien). Here’s my translation:
  Grammar, with its mixture of logical rules and arbitrary use, provides a child with its first exposure to the frameworks for human conduct that will confront it later: law, morality, every system that humanity has devised to order instinctive experience.</description>

In fact, the script sounds more like an ad for English assimilation–the son doesn’t seem to speak much Spanish; ¿y porqué habla el papá el inglés con su hijo dentro el espacio privado de un coche unless this is the goal?</description>

      <description>Jim Waldo writes that it’s a good idea to send objects over wires (when doing IPC, etc.), and Tim Bray challenged him somewhat to consider sending XML instead. Waldo replied that you still have to define the semantics, and, of course, Bray agrees.
TANSTAAFL, of course. There has to be some kind of social agreement in place for the systems that people write to make sense of messages. Sometimes that agreement is to use natural language (English, etc.</description>

      <description>I received an email from Justin Bur that says (quoting with permission):
 Your English version of Borges’ celebrated essay http://www.entish.org/essays/Wilkins.html contains a rather spectacular mistranslation based presumably on a typo in the original Spanish. Section 16 of Wilkins’ taxonomy classifies the *whale*, not beauty, as a viviparous oblong fish. There is a complete text online at http://reliant.teknowledge.com/Wilkins, and the relevant passage is on page 132. The confusion seems to arise from the graphic similarity between “ballena” (whale) and “belleza” (beauty) in Spanish.</description>

 [T]hanks to the miracle of speech, we know, probably better than the other animals, that we actually know very little, in other words, we are conscious of the existence of mystery. Confronted by mystery-and at the same time aware of the virtually constitutive power of words for us-we have tried incessantly to address that which is concealed by mystery, and influence it with our words.</description>

 By this time [1769] the original colonial designations of “Christian” and “Indian” were giving way to “white,” “red” and, with the increase in slave traffic, “black”: “Color didn’t originate with Indian-white relations but with slavery,” said University of Connecticut historian Nancy Shoemaker. “It is slavery that makes color seem to be a way to organize people.”
 But the original use probably came from Native Americans themselves, says Ives Goddard.</description>

      <description>Adults can be retrained to learn second languages more easily, says UCL scientist (via Mirabilis.ca). This looks encouraging; still, it’s a small study–the study showed that a study of 63 Japanese ESL students were able to increase their perception of the r/l distinction in English by 18% after 10 sessions. Still, the r/l distinction is notoriously difficult (even native speakers of English end up going for ‘speech therapy’ to learn how to produce the r/l distinction).</description>

The Ethnologue, probably the single best reference on the demographics of the world’s languages, lists 516 nearly extinct languages., including 170 in the Americas–about 7% of the 6912 ‘living languages’ the Ethnologue describes. They list 73 extinct languages in the USA.</description>

It’s interesting to note that the compression ratio went down with the addition of the Bill of Rights.

      <description>Jean Véronis describes an informal experiment in compressing different texts, including the European constitution. (Original in French, Auto-translated to English). He notes that normally, French texts compress at about 60-65% of the original, but the EU constitution compresses at about 75%. He puts this down to “jargon, puffery, redundancy…” in the constitution. I wonder what the US Constitution is (before and after any admendments added after the Bill of Rights).

      <description>Much fun about teaching English as a foreign language, as I did in a former life; including a bitter essay that pretty much explains why I stopped teaching EFL.
 After the age of 40, English teachers are burnt-out, skill-less and unemployable, their working lives a wasteland, their future oblivion. Suicide attempts are not unheard of. A former colleague of mine, a charming and talented but fatally lazy Scotsman who was well on his way to drinking himself to death, was recently found in a pool of blood, having tried to finish himself off by slashing his wrists.</description>

      <description>A good Globe ad Mail report on what they claim is the “first-ever full-fledged scholarly conference on Canadian English”, the Canadian English in a Global Context conference, which took place this past weekend. Going to the conference site leads to this link for Canadian English studies. The CBC did a show on Talking Canadian when I lived there, but I missed it, unfortunately.</description>

      <description>I came across a You know you’re from Michigan when… list, and it had the following item:
 When giving directions, you refer to “A Michigan Left.”Hmm, I’ve never heard of this, but searching the web I found this: The Michigan Left-Hand Turn, complete with diagrams. Fortunately, we don’t have any of these in Kalamazoo, although they’re a bane whenever I drive Gratiot Avenue when I visit my father near Detroit.</description>

      <description>From: Do You Speak American / Sea to Shining Sea / American Varieties / Midwest:
 Indeed, it is not uncommon to find Michiganders who will claim that the speech of national broadcasters is modeled on their dialect. Even a cursory comparison of the speech of the network news anchors with that of the local news anchors in Detroit will reveal the fallacy of such claims.and
  As long as Midwesterners are viewed as average, boring or otherwise nondescript, their speech will be seen through the same prism.</description>

      <description>The New Yorker has a somewhat amusing application form for disgruntled Democrats who want to move to Canada, which includes this question:
 Translate the following statement: “Cripes, grade thirteen! Here’s a loonie — buy a Coffee Crisp, eh?”Geoff Pullum can’t make heads or tails of it. But (having been a Canadian resident for several weeks and author of The Canadian Quiz, I think I’m on the case:

      <description>I remembered a post by Mark Liberman about disambiguation of complex nominals when I visited a doughnut shop today. The post points out that, when trying to determine automatically whether a phrase like “sickle cell anemia” is (say) sickle-type cell anemia or an anemia of sickle cells — i.e., whether it’s [sickle] [cell anemia] or [sickle cell] [anemia]–you can do something very simple, which works very well in practice: count the number of times “sickle cell” and “cell anemia” occur in a large body of texts, and the more frequent is likely to be the right grouping.</description>

      <description>I was at a bookstore yesterday, and came across an American slang dictionary. “Flub the dub” was included, meaning to make a mistake. Google gives more results, including translations of American slang into Korean and Russian.
Via Yahoo Search: Flub-a-dub was a cast member on Howdy Doody. Flubadubya is a screen name on the Democratic Underground. And, finally, it even shows up in the Bible.</description>

      <description>I was listening to Johnny Cash’s version of “In the Jailhouse Now,” which has the line:
 Well Old Bill really flubbed his dub when he wore a tuxedo to the country club. I did a quick search for “flubbed his dub” on Google, and only this Hindu Unity rant came back. You can find “flub your dub” a couple of times, including this bluegrass song. I assume that ‘flub (your) dub” means make a big mistake; but how did this Southernism get to India?</description>

      <description>An An by Mark Liberman on the current political discourse, which centers on impossible to recall events of decades ago instead of the real issues:
 We have free speech in this country, and access to a magnificently flexible and expressive language. This power of linguistic expression, granted to our species alone it would seem, is strong magic. We must be very careful what we do with it. This descent into slander and false memory recovery and document forgery and history denial and mutual accusations of cowardice and treachery is not the free discussion of political matters that the authors of the First Amendment envisaged for us.</description>
