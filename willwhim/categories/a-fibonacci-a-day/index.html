      Well, I didn’t think I’d write another Fibonacci A Day post — but there’s a great fibonacci function that’s defined right in the Scala documents, in their discussion of Streams.
A stream is a standard Scala data structure which is very list like. Recall that a Scala list has two parts, a head and a tail; the head is a value, and the tail is either the special empty list (Nil), or another list.

      I am taking Martin Odensky’s Functional Programming in Scala class, and discovered (or rediscovered) that the Fibonacci function is discussed in SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, the book that Odensky seems to be basing much of his Functional Programming in Scala course on).
Even more interesting is that a Fibonacci function which runs in O(lg(n)) steps is presented — that is, it takes about lg(n) steps to compute the _n_th Fibonacci number, instead of n steps.

      We are now confident that the fast recursive version is the best of the algorithms we have explored — it is fast, and can handle large values of the Fibonacci function.
I haven’t been happy, though, with returning a negative -1 when the function is called with a negative number — this feels like a kind of silent error we were trying to avoid in going to BigInts. Fortunately, it turns out that there is a natural extension of the Fibonacci sequence to negative numbers.

I ran them through a very simple benchmarking routine, and empirically tested them for the maximum size they can handle. Each benchmark was run 1000 times, except the first algorithm, which was run just once — we already know it runs too slow. These were run on a MacBook Air (Late 2010).

      Although the iterative recursive version is stateless, it looks different from the standard mathematical definition. The recursive version is a very close mapping, but it’s extremely inefficient. One way to overcome the inefficiencies is to dynamically record (or memoize) previous calculations of F(n). The idea is simple — if we already know the values of F(n – 1) and F(n – 2), we can simply add them without having to do the difficult steps in recreating them.

      The Fibonacci sequence has a very strong connection to the Golden Ratio (φ, or Phi). φ is defined as (√5 + 1)/2, or approximately 1.618, and has lots of special properties. Ron Knott has a web page with over 300 Fibonacci and φ formulas. One of these is this direct formula: F(n) = round(φn/√5), where the rounding function does rounding to the nearest whole number.
This gives us a quite an efficient function:

      We have seen a very inefficient recursive version of the Fibonacci function, and an efficient iterative version. Is there an efficient recursive version?
Yes, in fact. Recall that the definition of the Fibonacci function, F(n) is:
F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
What’s important to note is that the recursive step of the Fibonacci formula has two values that need to be accumulated. In the iterative version, the two temporary variables u and v are used to accumulate these values.

      Yesterday’s iterative version of the Fibonacci function is pretty speedy, especially compared to the recursive version. It calculates F(1000) in almost no time at all —
But. The result for F(1000) looks suspiciously low — and odd things happen if we use a different ‘high’ number, such as 100:
As it turns out, Scala’s Int and Long types are always signed, and do silent overflow. Once the number gets to a certain size, adding more will turn it ‘negative,’ and adding even more will eventually turn it positive, but (of course) the number is not correct.

      Yesterday’s Fibonacci function was recursive, but we saw that it was extremely inefficient. Recursive functions typically break down a problem into smaller pieces, solve the smaller pieces, then combine the results into a final result, where “breaking down” a problem is done by the recursive function calling itself on a smaller version of itself. But, as we saw, it’s possible that the number of times this may happen has to be controlled, or gross inefficiencies may occur; this sometimes gives recursion a bad name.

pi/4 = Σk=1arccot(F(2k+1)) summed to ∞, where F(n) is the _n_th Fibonacci number.

      The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers 0,1,1,2,3,5,8, … such that the nth number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers; and the the first two numbers are defined to be 0 and 1.
The Fibonacci function is a function which returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. It’s kind of a famous function in computer science when people are first learning about recursive functions.
