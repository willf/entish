      <description>I am glad that Natalia Cecire has published a commentary — The passion of Nate Silver (sort of) — on the recent attacks and counter-attacks on Nate Silver’s predictions for the upcoming presidential debate on his New York Times hosted blog, FiveThirtyEight. Silver was described by MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough as an “ideologue” and a “joke” who is biased in favor of Obama; and Silver’s defenders have accused his attackers as, among other things, “innumerate” and “braying idiot detractors.</description>

      <description>US Representative and Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin has been under fire for his use of the expression, “legitimate rape” during an interview about whether abortion should be legal in the case of rape. Akin said:
 First of all, from what I understand from doctors [pregnancy from rape] is really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work, or something.</description>

      <description>This American Life released a retraction today about it story reporting on working conditions at Apple suppliers in China. Kudos to This American Life for spending an entire show on this.
I’m afraid that This American Life’s focus on its own errors might overshadow the truths about working conditions in China. To their credit, they spend some time trying to get at the facts.
In the final minutes, Ira Glass interviews Charles Duhigg of the New York Times, who has done his own investigation of working conditions at Apple.</description>

      <description>In the wake of the horrible killings in Norway, I saw several tweets and Facebook posts that were something like “Brown: terrorist. White: extremist. Got it.” or “It speaks volumes that the immediate assumption was that this was the work of Muslim terrorists.” In other words, people began quite quickly to comment on the media reaction to the story, criticizing (implicitly or explicitly) for being anti-Muslim. This seemed odd to me, because by the time I started to see stories about the killings, the stories themselves were tentative about what the motivations of the killer or killers were.</description>

      <description>The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life released a report on how much Americans know about some religious facts; they have a online quiz version of their survey that’s making the rounds.
NPR reported on this in their story “Survey: Atheists, Agnostics Know More About Religion Than Religious,” and the LA Times did as well in their story “Atheists, agnostics most knowledgeable about religion, survey says.” For some reason, the actual report from the Pew Forum is unavailable as I write, but much of the details can be found at the online quiz.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin argues in his post Watch the money that one can tell a good life insurance salesperson by how much insurance they bought a lot of their own insurance; and you can tell a good non-profit person by how much they give to charity. Both of these statements seem right on the face of things, but are, I believe, false.
First, I think Mr Godin is (perhaps) confusing moral good and monetary achievement.</description>

      <description>In 1970, when I was in eighth grade, I took a Current Events class. During the previous summer, Ted Kennedy drove his car into the Chappaquiddick, leaving his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, in the car; she was found dead the next day.
The case came up in Civics class. I defended Kennedy. My case, if I recall correctly, was that he was a Very Important Man–the brother of Jack Kennedy, our dear assassinated president, and of Robert Kennedy–hadn’t his family suffered enough?</description>

      <description>From the Washington Post, “Big donors drive Obama’s money edge“:
 Lost in the attention given to Obama’s Internet surge is that only a quarter of the $600 million he has raised has come from donors who made contributions of $200 or less, according to a review of his FEC reports. That is actually slightly less, as a percentage, than President Bush raised in small donations during his 2004 race, although Obama has pulled from a far larger number of donors.</description>

      <description>Over at FiveThirtyEight, the following ‘homework assignment’ was given:
 How many unique ways are there to acquire at least 270 electoral votes without any excess? I figured it would be a ‘large’ number, but I was surprised at the actual total: 51,199,463,116,367 (or, fifty-one trillion and change). about 2.3% of all possible combinations (This exact number is based on the simplifying assumption of treating Maine and Nevada as giving up their electoral votes in the same way as all the other states).</description>

      <description>ACLU report:
 NEW YORK – The results of an internal Justice Department investigation released today reveal that officials at the highest level of government — including the White House — received reports on the abuse of prisoners in U.S. military custody overseas as early as 2002. Congress called on the department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to conduct the investigation after documents made public through an American Civil Liberties Union Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request revealed FBI agents at Guantánamo had raised concerns about methods used by military interrogators.</description>

      <description>The Detroit Free Press is reporting on a new plan to seat Michigan delegates at the Democratic convention. The idea is to give Clinton 69 regular delegates, and Obama 59. “The proposal also would seat the state’s 29 superdelegates.”
I suspect the hidden (Clinton) agenda is to seat the superdelegates.
Since these superdelegates were responsible for the mess we’re in, it would make more sense to me to split the delegates 64/64 between Clinton and Obama, and leave the superdelegates at home.</description>

      <description>Bush personally approved meetings to arrange torture, which were led by Cheney.
 If you consider what the government did to be torture, which is a crime according to U.S. and international law, Bush’s statement shifts his role from being an accessory after the fact to being part of a conspiracy to commit.

      <description>More stuff worth reading: Joseph Stiglitz’s testimony before Congress on the cost of the Iraqi War (pdf):
 I have, so far, emphasized the direct economic costs as well as the opportunity costs—the diversion of funds that could have been used in so many other and better ways. I would be remiss, however, if I did not note that there are other costs: in the long run, the squandering of America’s leadership role in the international community, the diversion of attention from critical global issues, including issues like global warming and nuclear proliferation in North Korea—that simply won’t go away on their own, and that cannot simply wait to be addressed—may represent the largest and most longstanding legacy of this unfortunate war.</description>

      <description>Obama’s speech is well worth watching.
 For we have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division, and conflict, and cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle – as we did in the OJ trial – or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina – or as fodder for the nightly news. We can play Reverend Wright’s sermons on every channel, every day and talk about them from now until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words.</description>

      <description>Update: Good comments by Fred Clark at slacktivist.
From the New York Times:
 Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been an outspoken opponent of torture, often referring to his own experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. In this case he supported the administration’s position, arguing as Mr. Bush did Saturday that the legislation would have limited the C.I.A.’s ability to gather intelligence. So, McCain is in favor of allowing the US to practice such cruel and inhuman punishment and torture as:</description>

      <description>Should Michigan redo its Democratic primary for president?
I think it was shameful, scandalous and grossly stupid that our Governor Granholm, Senator Levin, and the state Democratic and Republican committees disenfranchised Michigan voters.
Millions of dollars were spent holding a sham election in which the only Democratic front-runner on the ticket was Senator Clinton. Her presence on the ballot was itself a masterful bit of triangulation, allowing her to garner votes while not spending any money on campaigning in Michigan and publicly committing to honor the Democratic National Committee’s rules.</description>

      <description>Hitchens on the Iowa caucus racket:
I was in Des Moines and Ames in the early fall, and I must say that, as small and landlocked and white and rural as Iowa is, I would be happy to give an opening bid in our electoral process to its warm and generous a
 nd serious people. But this is not what the caucus racket actually does. What it does is give the whip hand to the moneyed political professionals, to the full-time party hacks and manipulators, to the shady pollsters and the cynical media boosters, and to the supporters of fringe and crackpot candidates.</description>

      <description>One year from now, we’ll be electing a new president and voting for new members of Congress. Has our next eight years ever been so predictable?
November, 1998. Hillary Clinton wins the election with a large electoral vote majority, and about 55% of the popular vote, the first woman elected president (with Barack Obama as the first African-American vice-president). Democrats gain control of both houses.
First term. Pull-out from Iraq is slow, deadly and met with unconcern by the American public.</description>

      <description>There must be an antonym for ‘hype.’ To hype something is to engage in hyperbole about it: Apple products have generated their share of hype. (For example: Steve Jobs said, “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”) I don’t mean ‘anti-hype’ in the sense of telling the approximate truth about something, desengaño or dis-illusionment. But after the IPhone announcement, Steve Ballmer said, “There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.</description>

On Saturday, I attended the Golden Gate Sacred Harp singing in San Francisco (with a nice Après-chant at Philip’s house, nicely described by Linda, who also has pictures of the singing). In the morning today, Jeff Shrager took me to see redwoods and banana slugs and tidepools, capped by some nice bluegrass music at a cafe. Worship at Sojourners was also good.

      <description>Last night, we went to a Good Friday service which included a meal, and I sat down next to my very Republican friend, Butch, who never has anything good to say about government (despite, or perhaps because of, having been a government social services employee for years). We don’t usually talk politics–the gap between us is too large and our friendship too fragile for this–but he started complaining about recent proposals to raise taxes to fix Michigan roads.</description>

      <description>The blogosphere is abuzz with discussions about the controversy about censorship of the Newbery Medal winning children’s book “The Higher Power of Lucky,” because it contains the word ‘scrotum’ on the first page, especially after an article about the controversy appeared on the first page of The New York Times (the article in question, soon to be behind the Times’s paywall).

      <description>The Rev. Vernon Tyson remembers ‘Miss Amy’s witness,’ during the civil rights era in Raleigh, North Carolina.
 In 1963, when the Rev. Vernon Tyson was pastor of Jonesboro Methodist Church in Sanford, he invited Dr. Samuel Proctor to preach for what was called Race Relations Sunday. Proctor, an African-American and one of the leading theologians in the United States until his death in 1997, was then president of North Carolina A&amp;amp;T in Greensboro.</description>

There are many Ivins quotes on the web, but this one struck me as typical Ivins when she first announced her cancer diagnosis: Go. Get. The. Damn. Mammogram. Done.</description>

      <description>Sarah Vowell spoke at the Dowagiac Dogwood Fine Arts Festival tonight. She read from her books for about half the time, and took questions the other half–about 45 minutes each. I enjoyed her most when she was slightly off script while reading–making side comments of various sorts about the topic at hand. I’d just finished reading Assassination Vacation on the plane back from vacation (her generally delightful book about the assassinations of Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley as well as their assassinators).</description>

      <description>Fred Clark has a provocative article, Dirty work, that makes an interesting point about people who do the ‘dirty work’ of torture, such as our American agents who engage in tortuous activities such as waterboarding. First, he notes that these people, at the end of the day, must enjoy their work, and thus are worthy of being called sadists, sociopaths, sexual perverts or worse. (This reminds me of Miss Hardcastle in Lewis’s That Hideous Strength).</description>

      <description>It’s looking as if Neil Armstrong did say “One small step for a man…” rather than “One small step for man…”; this is what he has always maintained as his intent (Houston Chronicle story; via /.).
Perhaps someday historians will correct it again to “That’s one small step for a man; one giant leap for humanity.”
Update: I should have been a bit more skeptical, I think. At least taken a closer look at the data, which David Beaver has now done in a post on Language Log.</description>

 We purchased a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson Reach Easyglide Pro Freshmint Floss, and have had the following problems: – there is so much wax on the floss, it is hard to use because it slips in our hands, – there is so much wax on the floss, it is hard to get between our teeth, – it is almost impossible to cut the floss using the included cutter, – the cutter and feeder are poorly attached to the body, and so collapsed when trying to cut the floss, – the idea of having a ‘pro’ floss stikes us as silly as best and insulting at worst, – we resent having to pay extra for non-functioning products (often, we are unable to purchase J&amp;amp;J’s basic waxed floss because stores do not carry it).</description>

      <description>A definition from the electronic dictionary program that comes with the Macintosh (based the New Oxford American English Dictionary):
 faith-based (adjective): affiliated with or based on religion or a religious group : a faith-based plan that bilked investors out of millions. USAGE The preponderance of usage for this term today connects it with institutions and programs that are affiliated with an organized religion, and with President George W. Bush’s faith-based initiative, which enables religious institutions doing social work to receive government funding.</description>

 The manuscript of the first protest against slavery in North America — written in Germantown in 1688 by a group that included Quakers and former Mennonites — has been rediscovered more than 50 years after it was last seen. The document was uncovered this spring in the vault at the Arch Street Friends Meetinghouse in downtown Philadelphia, according to Randy Nyce, director of the Germantown Mennonite Historic Trust.</description>

With the talk of new immigration laws in the air, some immigration activists are calling for a ‘stay-at-home’ protest on May 1. I’m starting my new job then, so I don’t think it would be wise to not go to work on my first day… But it did encourage me to write to my US representative and senators:</description>

 THERE is no such thing as a “Christian politics.” If it is a politics, it cannot be Christian. Jesus told Pilate: “My reign is not of this present order. If my reign were of this present order, my supporters would have fought against my being turned over to the Jews. But my reign is not here” (John 18:36). Jesus brought no political message or program.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time–back in the early 80’s–I taught English as a Second Language. A number of my students were Bahá’ís from Iran. I remember one student in particular who wasn’t doing very well, and whom I had to ask to come to my office to discuss her academic situation. It turned out that she was very motivated to correct any problems she was having, because if she failed and lost her student visa, she would have to return to Iran, and face the ongoing persecution of Bahá’í believers by the Shia-controlled government.</description>

      <description>Many interesting stats, including:
 White evangelical Christians were solidly behind the president throughout his first term in office, but that support has waned over the past 15 months. Currently, just 54% of white evangelicals approve of the president’s job in office, while 36% disapprove. Bush’s support has also dropped among people who attend church each week or more frequently. According to post-election exit polls conducted by the National Election Pool, these voters backed Bush over Kerry by a 61%-38% margin.</description>

Lesser oppressors came and surrounded me as well. Surrounded my friends, and me. Yet I held out the Light, even as they hid us, And pursued justice in places of fear and anger.</description>

      <description>Ex-C.I.A. Official Says Iraq Data Was Distorted – New York Times
 But Mr. Pillar is the first high-level C.I.A. insider to speak out by name on the use of prewar intelligence. His article for the March-April issue of Foreign Affairs, which charges the administration with the selective use of intelligence about Iraq’s unconventional weapons and the chances of postwar chaos in Iraq, was posted Friday on the journal’s Web site after it was reported in The Washington Post.</description>

      <description>I didn’t know that NPR had a national religion correspondent, Barbara Bardley Hagerty. She did a segment this morning called “Evangelical leaders urge action on climate change.” (Amusingly, the written version transcribes ‘evangelical’ twice as ‘evangelican.’) Bradley seems to do about an article a week, according to her recent stories list.</description>

      <description>According to this article at Military.com, Bush sent a request for $439.3 billion defense budget for FY 2007, a seven percent increase. This does not count the ongoing cost of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which, the article states, currently cost over $80 billion per year.
Hmm, the US Census says there are about 105 million households (2000 census data). Let’s round down the budget request to $500 billion, and the household population to 100 million; this means Bush is asking for $5,000 per household.</description>

      <description>Toyota received a lot of publicity (for example) for their ‘bilingual’ Camry advertisement: a father explains to his son that he bought a hybrid car for the same reason he learned English, ‘for your future.’ But it’s not very bilingual–just one phrase (‘mira, mira aquí’). In fact, the script sounds more like an ad for English assimilation–the son doesn’t seem to speak much Spanish; ¿y porqué habla el papá el inglés con su hijo dentro el espacio privado de un coche unless this is the goal?</description>

 With more than 10,000,000 copies sold since it first appeared in 1960, “To Kill a Mockingbird” exists as one of the best-selling novels of all time. For decades, Ms. Lee has remained fiercely mindful of her privacy, politely but resolutely refusing to talk to the press and making only rare public appearances, in which she always declines to speak.</description>

      <description>The very government itself seems an organized scramble, and Congress a boys’ debating-club, with the disadvantage of being reported. As our party-creeds are commonly represented less by ideas than by persons, (who are assumed, without too close a scrutiny, to be the exponents of certain ideas,) our politics become personal and narrow to a degree never paralleled, unless in ancient Athens or mediaeval Florence. Our Congress debates and our newspapers discuss, sometimes for day after day, not questions of national interest, not what is wise and right, but what the Honorable Lafayette Skreemer said on the stump, or bad whiskey said for him, half a dozen years ago.</description>

      <description>On November 26, four members of the Christian Peacemaker Teams were kidnapped in Iraq by a previously unknown group called the Swords of Righteousness. The CPT team was in Iraq investigating abuses by the occupying forces (they provided some of the first news on Abu Ghraib and other abuse cases in Iraq). Their motto is being “committed to reducing violence by ‘Getting in the way,&amp;rsquo;” which means putting themselves in dangerous spots just so violence may be reduced because of public pressure, changes of heart, putting on spotlight on abuse, etc.</description>

      <description>[Belated Blog against racism day essay]
Many, if not most, institutional systems in the United States were explicitly, and without apology, created with racist intentions. Our constitution declared ‘Persons held to Service or Labour’ (that is, black slaves) to be worth only three-fifths of a regular citizen with respect to representation. Educational systems were set up as separate systems for blacks and whites. Housing covenants were written to restrict blacks and other minorities from living in certain neighborhoods.</description>

      <description>Interesting article Why are American presidential election campaigns so variable when votes are so predictable? (pdf) by Andrew Gelman and Gary King. First, I didn’t know that presidential elections were so predictable, but apparently they are (close races are predictably close, not-so-close races are predictably not-so-close) based on certain relatively well-known independent variables. Second, the authors make a good case about why voter polls are so variable. Basically, people eventually gather enough information to make a decision based on their real preferences; and at the point (which is usually near the election).</description>

 Setting up a possible veto showdown with the White House, the Senate voted overwhelmingly for an amendment to a Pentagon spending bill that sets standards for the treatment of prisoners in U.S. military custody. The measure, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, would require American troops to follow interrogation standards set in the Army Field Manual and bar “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” of prisoners in U.</description>

The sticking point is, of course, the last phrase: “envious Jews.</description>

      <description>A Linguist’s Alternative History of ‘Redskin’
 By this time [1769] the original colonial designations of “Christian” and “Indian” were giving way to “white,” “red” and, with the increase in slave traffic, “black”: “Color didn’t originate with Indian-white relations but with slavery,” said University of Connecticut historian Nancy Shoemaker. “It is slavery that makes color seem to be a way to organize people.”
 But the original use probably came from Native Americans themselves, says Ives Goddard.</description>

      <description>Donna Abrahams writes on the Fasola (Sacred Harp) mailing list:
 Judge Jackson himself wrote “Florida Storm.” Many regard it as the quintessential “Colored Sacred Harp” song. It immortalizes a category 4 hurricane known only as Hurricane #6 that hit the Gulf Coast — including southern Florida — in 1926. I kept thinking of the words all during Katrina, which (very sadly) turned out to be about as appropriate today as they were then.</description>

      <description>Oh my. News comes from my sister-in-law that the local Nazi group in Cadillac was awarded this certificate of appreciation for picking up trash. I went to high-school just 30 miles from Cadillac; the Michigan Militia was active there after I left; I guess it’s still active, according to their website.</description>

Joe Barton of the House Energy Committee has asked three scientists for data–both scientific and personal–underlying their investigations into global warming. The USA Today article and Realclimate.org post helpfully links to the original letter sent by Barton, as well as to the scientists’ and others’ responses (mostly PDF files):

      <description>Poor Kalamazoo: It looks like Pfizer is moving some 500 research jobs out of the area (most of these are actually in Portage, the city just to our south). They’re leaving most of the manuafacturing jobs, and animal research in the area, as well as a small research group. Kalamazoo was the world headquarters of the Upjohn Company, which merged with Pharmacia and then swallowed by Pfizer. This doesn’t bode well for Kalamazoo’s long term future.</description>

 Incidents like this remind us that reporters really do want to do what reporters should do — hammer hypocrisy, discover the facts, and write stories that level with readers. But cowed by bias charges and handcuffed by conventions that keep reporters from calling a lie a lie, all too often they shy away from writing stories that cut through the bull—-.

      <description>I’m pretty sure that this Freakonomics article is in error. Previously, Steven Levitt estimated that the odds are about 10,000 to 1 against being arrested for soliciting in Chicago. But here he marvels at an unlucky patron who was arrested twice in the span of about a week. It was Marilyn vos Savant who pointed out that, although flipping a coin ten times and getting ten heads was as likely as any other permutation, if you did see ten heads in a row, you should be suspicous of the coin.</description>

      <description>According to this Salon article:
 On a tape recording made on Feb. 28, 1973, Dean can be heard telling Nixon that Felt was “the only person that knows” details that had been leaked to the Post. Dean later rejected the notion; in an electronic book published by Salon in 2002, he said he didn’t think there was “any way Felt could have been Deep Throat.”

      <description>It appears that the Washington Post is confirming that Mark Felt was Deep Throat. The Watergate hearings and Nixon’s resignation dominated the news the summer between high school and college for me, so Watergate coverage always has a special coming of age tinge for me.
For some reason–probably because I’ve never liked him much–I’m also glad that none of John Dean’s five possible candidates for Deep Throat was Mark Felt.</description>

More evidence that Bush et al. cooked the evidence for WMD in Iraq:
 …Bush said in his Jan. 28, 2003, State of the Union address that Hussein was working to obtain “significant quantities” of uranium from Africa, a conclusion the president attributed to British intelligence and made a key part of his assertion that Iraq had an active nuclear weapons program.More than a year later, the White House retracted the statement after its veracity was questioned.</description>

      <description>From a secret Downing Street memo written in July, 2002 (eight months before the war began):
 The Foreign Secretary [Jack Straw] said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.</description>

 Although Mugabe is regarded as evil incarnate by Zimbabwe’s Roman Catholic hierarchy, he does have friends elsewhere in the Christian Community. Zimbabwe’s Anglican primate, Bishop Nolbert Kunonga, has used his pulpit at St Mary’s Cathedral in Harare to support Mugabe and his land reform programme.
He was rewarded by Mugabe with one of the farms, St Marnock’s, outside Harare, confiscated from its previous white owner, 25-year-old Marcus Hale.</description>

 Indeed, it is not uncommon to find Michiganders who will claim that the speech of national broadcasters is modeled on their dialect. Even a cursory comparison of the speech of the network news anchors with that of the local news anchors in Detroit will reveal the fallacy of such claims.and
  As long as Midwesterners are viewed as average, boring or otherwise nondescript, their speech will be seen through the same prism.</description>

      <description>Michigan went for Gore in 2000, and for Kerry in 2004, by relatively small amounts: Gore got 51.3% of the vote in 2000 (with 2.6% going to 3rd parties). Kerry got 51.1% of the vote in 2004 (with 1% going to third parties).
Voting was up 13.7% over 2000. Most interesting is the disparity between Democrats and Republicans: Democratic voters were up 13.3%, but Republicans were up 18.1%.
It’s interesting to pull out two counties: my own (Kalamazoo) and Wexford, a largely rural county in northern lower Michigan (the county seat is Cadillac, where my sister-in-law Jean and her family just moved–and she immediately jumped into the Democratic get out the vote).</description>

      <description>My projections: Kerry: 320, Bush: 218 electoral votes. Also, although there might be some question about some states’ final votes, I predict the differences will be large enough that we’ll know pretty well by tomorrow morning.

      <title>How my vote went</title>

      <description>I voted in Kalamazoo, Michigan; our district uses optical scanners. I arrived around 7:30 am. I vote at the school my daughter attends, and I walked her down. The line was quite long — it was cool and a bit drizzly, but I didn’t sense that people were leaving. I got out at 8:40. I noticed that I was the 101st voter; the previous voter was right ahead of me. So, with the polls opening at 7:00, this means they were handling about 1 voter per minute.</description>

      <description>This election is for them (picture of a white soldier, a white mother and child). DON’T LET THEM DOWN! Strong defense and security, a commitment to protecting America, to protecting or families–Our President, our Commander in Chief George W. Bush is the strong and steady leader we need. Without your vote, he’ll be forced to step down and surrender his position to an upredictable and risky candidate with a completely different set of priorities for America.</description>

      <description>[The senior Whitehouse aide] told me something that at the time I didn’t fully comprehend — but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.
The aide said that guys like me were ”in what we call the reality-based community,” which he defined as people who ”believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.” I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism.</description>

      <description>Tim Bray recommends:
 If you’re running a company and there’s a general perception that your CEO is [an expletive for fool], eventually it won’t matter that much whether he really is or isn’t; the perception will become an obstacle. And right now, the United States of America is facing that obstacle.

      <description>People always want “knock-out blows” in a debate, but there weren’t any, of course. Bush usually sounded less desparate than he did in the first two debates; he always seems more intelligent when he’s calm. Kerry’s performance was exactly the same as in the first two debates: “presidential,” in a word. CBS’s instant poll of undecideds said a plurality thought Kerry had won the debate.
I could be wrong, but I think this debate shows that the right’s use of “liberal” as a scare word is dying.</description>

      <description>Watching this debate, I found myself much more interested in the horserace–who was winning? who was losing? It seemed clear to me that the President was on the defensive; he even sounded desparate to me (although he seemed to calm down during the last 20 minutes or so). Kerry seemed, well, presidential and wise. Both candidates wandered off a little too often and a little too far from the questions they were asked–but this is a problem that’s bothered me for 30 years or so.</description>

      <description>I didn’t know about FactCheck.org before the debate, and before Cheney mentioned it (and erroneously called it FactCheck.com, which, apparently overnight, is now a link to a George Soros site). It’s a very useful, non-partisan site set up to check the claims made by politicians. They have a great essay on why it’s legal for politicians to lie to us.</description>

      <description>Gwen Ifill asked Edwards, “What qualifies you to be a heartbeat away?” Cheney’s follow-up was interesting:
 FILL: Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds.
CHENEY: You want me to answer a question about his qualifications?
IFILL: That was the question.
CHENEY: I see.
Well, I think the important thing in picking a vice president probably varies from president to president. Different presidents approach it in different ways.
When George Bush asked me to sign on, it obviously wasn’t because he was worried about carrying Wyoming.</description>

      <description>Initial reactions: Today, I’m optimistic about America. Our local paper reports that about 96% of Michigan residents who could register to vote, have registered to vote. It’s clear that this election has stirred interests in and emotions about the political life of our country in ways that haven’t happened in a long time. The candidates were clearly different (as in the first presidential debate) and each gave a ‘very good and forceful presentation of themselves’ (as I just heard on the radio).</description>

      <description>According to Bruce Schneier, the Bush adminstration wants to put RFID tags in our passports.
 Unfortunately, there is only one possible reason: The administration wants surreptitious access [to the broadcast information on the passports] themselves. It wants to be able to identify people in crowds. It wants to surreptitiously pick out the Americans, and pick out the foreigners. It wants to do the very thing that it insists, despite demonstrations to the contrary, can’t be done.</description>

      <description>Bush was well-briefed, articulate and scowling. Kerry was well-briefed, articulate and, well, presidential. The debate centered, justifiably, on the war in Iraq, although Bush kept wanting to make it a debate on who is more steadfast. Kerry didn’t quite make the point he should be: that, when you make a mistake, it’s muleish to be maintain the same path. Bush hammered on the “steadfastness” theme:

      <description>An An by Mark Liberman on the current political discourse, which centers on impossible to recall events of decades ago instead of the real issues:
 We have free speech in this country, and access to a magnificently flexible and expressive language. This power of linguistic expression, granted to our species alone it would seem, is strong magic. We must be very careful what we do with it. This descent into slander and false memory recovery and document forgery and history denial and mutual accusations of cowardice and treachery is not the free discussion of political matters that the authors of the First Amendment envisaged for us.</description>

      <description>On Thursday, the US briefed reporters on a draft report on the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Although it states that Iraq clearly intended to produce WMD at some point, no significant evidence of WMDs have been found. This is very significant because:
  The US went to war in Iraq citing the immediate danger of Iraq’s WMD program.
  The UN inspection program in Iraq argued that WMDs were very unlikely.</description>

      <description>Ralph Nader visited Kalamazoo today. Among other things, he tolld the audience (according to the Kalamazoo Gazette article) to”vote your conscience.” And, in general, this seems like a reasonable thing to say. But, of course, Nader is only on the ballot in Michigan because the Republican Party passed out petitions for him, because they hope (and not unreasonably so) that this will draw votes away from Kerry. My conscience says not to vote for people who cannot attract enough workers to get on the ballot.</description>
