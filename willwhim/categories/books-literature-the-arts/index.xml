      <description>Of Truth
Francis Bacon, translated by Will Fitzgerald August 1, 2015
“What is truth?” asked jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. Certainly there have been those who delight in giddiness, and count it bondage to settle on a belief, who affect free will in thinking as well as in acting. And though the schools of philosophers of that kind are gone, there remain certain chattering wits of the same vein—though not with as much blood in them as there was in the ancients.</description>

      <title>A comment on “Computational linguistics and literary scholarship”</title>

      <description>There is a controversy over “Computational linguistics and literary scholarship.” A paper published at the Association for Computational Linguistics David Bamman, Brendan O’Connor, &amp;amp; Noah A. Smith, “Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters“) has come under criticims by Hannah Alpert-Abrams with Dan Garrette, “Some thoughts on the relationship between computational linguistics and literary scholarship“. The primary criticism has been that the ACL paper fails to cite any literary scholarship past the middle of the last century.</description>

      <title>Where did the “bon pour Nicole” folk etymology of “pumpernickel” come from?</title>

      <description>The origin of pumpernickel is relatively clear — the first part, at least, derives from the onomatopoeic German word Pumpf, or fart (Anatoly Lieberman has an interesting column connecting to pimp, and pimp to the history of faggot).
But there is a folk etymology that tells this story: when Napoleon was marching through Westphalia, he was given some of their rough, dark bread, and he said it was only “bon pour Nicole” — good for Nicole, his horse.</description>

      <description>There is a new iPad application out, a multimedia presentation of TS Eliot’s The Wasteland. I’ve only just begun to explore it. It seems to have its oddities, as all things do, I suppose: two pictures of Bob Dylan in the photo section, but only one of Eliot himself. But I’d never seen pictures of young Ezra Pound, and I thought—I know that guy, the confident artiste completely sure of his editorial prowess, more than willing to slash his way through the manuscript of The Wasteland; his edits are also included.</description>

      <description>Aristotle’s Feminist Subject: interesting weblog:
 This blog has been a way to interact with some of you around “subjects” that Aristotle has taught too many of us in the west, even today, to disparage: females, rhetoric, and translation. Until we’ve recovered, I guess I’ll blog a bit more . Also: The WOMBman’s Bible

      <description>Fun Michigan poem in the May 19, 2008 issue of the New Yorker by Bob Hicok, entitled “A Primer.”
You never forget how to be from Michigan when you’re from Michigan. It’s like riding a bike of ice and fly fishing. The Upper Peninsula is a spare state in case Michigan goes flat…

      <description>I enjoyed the Golden Gate Sacred Harp Singing this past week in San Francisco, and even managed to record the afternoon session (not a great recording, but not terrible either; the altos were strong, but perhaps not as strong as they sound in the recording). The singing was chaired by Natalia Cecire, who is working on a PhD in English at U.C. Berkeley.
I found a great quotation, by the way, in Natalia’s draft of a MLA presentation she gave, “From Stone Tablet to Pensieve: Media and History in Children’s Fantasy“:</description>

      <description>I like (parts of) this poem, which I found in the “Hutchinson’s Republican Songster, for the Campaign of 1860” on Google Books. The ‘Hutchinson’ is question is a member of the Hutchinson Family, a famous singing family of the mid-1800s. This is from Lincoln’s first campaign for president.

      <description>Jonathan Coulton is “a musician, a singer-songwriter and an internet superstar.” He wrote a sweet, goopy song called Code Monkey that I like, as well as a song about the Mandelbrot set. But he also wrote a song called “The Future Soon.” It it, the protagonist sings:
 Last week I left a note on Laura’s desk It said I love you signed anonymous friend Turns out she’s smarter than I thought she was She knows I wrote it, now the whole class does too … But I know that I’ll forget the look of pity in her face When I’m living in my solar dome on a platform in space.</description>

      <description>Here’s a QA with the primary gatekeeper to the New Yorker cartoon caption contest:
 Q. Did your predecessor or Bob give you any advice when looking through the responses? A. My predecessor stared me in the eyes and warned me that reading too many captions in one sitting could make a man crazy. Oh, and also to “pick the funny ones.” Q. After a while isn’t it difficult to decide what’s funny?</description>

      <description>An interesting idea: Ficlets. Anyone can write a 1k story portion (a “fictlet”); anyone can write prequels and sequels to any ficlet. All under a Creative Commons 2.5 license.
Is this a “bite size medium,” or will a chains of ficlets (or the entire space of probabilities for a ficlet chain) become a “full meal medium?”
Somewhere in academia, a PhD thesis is waiting to be born.

      <description>How do all things with names combine? Words are but nests, the meanings are the birds, Body the bed through which the spirit-river flows. The surface of this mental watercourse Is not without its chaff of good and bad repute: It flows, but you would say it stagnates; It moves but you would say it stays; From place to place were there no motion Whence these renewed supplies of floating chaff?</description>

      <description>The blogosphere is abuzz with discussions about the controversy about censorship of the Newbery Medal winning children’s book “The Higher Power of Lucky,” because it contains the word ‘scrotum’ on the first page, especially after an article about the controversy appeared on the first page of The New York Times (the article in question, soon to be behind the Times’s paywall).

      <description>St. Basil, who lived from around 330-379 CE, is one of the “three hierarchs” of the Orthodox Church. I’ve just finished reading (in a translation by RJ Deferrai), an excellent essay On the distinction between ousia and hypostasis. In this letter, he writes very clearly about the Christian view of God as Triune, in particular explaining the meaning of the technical terms ousia (abstract being) and hypostasis (individual being).
It’s good as a piece of theology, but it’s also interesting as clear technical writing.</description>

      <description>Jules Feiffer began writing children’s books in the early ’90s; his first children’s book, apparently somewhat autobiographical, was The Man in the Ceiling. Lovely wife got it out of the library, and I’ve read it this evening.
The story centers around Jimmy, a boy who isn’t much good in at sports (as a real boy should be), but who can draw cartoons very very well. He’s got a driven father, a forgetful mother who is a fashion designer; an older sister prone to tantrums, and a little overlooked sister prone to being a bit of a pest.</description>

      <description>I’ve just finished Mark Helprin’s picaresque novel Freddy and Fredericka. It’s a good book that could have been a great book–or, perhaps, a pretty good book that could have been a good book–with better editing. It’s conceit is wonderfully ludicrous: Freddy and Fredericka, the Prince and Princess of Wales, (based on Charles and Diana) are set the quest to reacquire the United States for the British Empire. They are parachuted into New Jersey under cover of darkness and face a number of American perils and adventures: fighting off a biker gang, traveling down Twain’s Mississippi, burgling modern art from the nouveau riche, tramping on freight trains.</description>

      <description>I’ve been quite enjoying reading The Barn at the End of the World, by Mary Rose O’Reilley, published by Milkweed Press. It reminds me a lot of the writing of Annie Dillard (who has her own website: ‘The Secrets of the Universe as Decoded by the Unhinged’): essays about mindfulness at the interface between the natural and artificial worlds, as well at the interface of the social and solitary life. O’Reilly has a kind of spiritual eclecticism (not only is she a Quaker Buddhist shepherd, but a former Catholic novitiate) that I find both appealing and a bit scandalous–why is this Quaker/Catholic bowing before a buddha?</description>

      <description>In the first chapter of Don Quixote, Cervantes introduces us to the modest straights of “the Ingenious Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha” by describing his diet:
 Una olla de algo más vaca que carnero, salpicón las más noches, duelos y quebrantos los sábados, lantejas los viernes, algún palomino de añadidura los domingos, consumían las tres partes de su hacienda. I’ve just started reading Edith Grossman’s new translation, and it contains the first paragraph from several English translations.</description>

      <description>Extremely surprising article at über-evangelical Christianity Today: Messy Revelation: Why Paul would have flunked hermeneutics by historian and biblical studies expert Susan Wise Bauer. It’s a very positive review of a book by Peter Enns titled Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament. Enns argues that the New Testament writers interpreted the Hebrew scriptures in the writers’ own social and cultural context–the writers had come to believe in Jesus as the resurrected Messiah, and then found evidence in the scriptures.</description>

Kalamazoo

      <description>So the Financial Times has a pretty good article on weblogging, Time for the last post (via kottke), but snarks about Orwell:
 The great critic and editor Cyril Connolly fell into despair over the prolixity of Orwell’s wartime writing: “Being Orwell, nothing he wrote is quite without value and unexpected gems keep popping up. But O the boredom of argument without action, politics without power.” Connolly was the constitutional opposite of Orwell – a spry wit given to sloth, a portly bon vivant who masticated away his genius.</description>

      <description>Nice essay by Natalia: On outsourcing art.
 Singing is a particularly sticky issue. There’s something horribly personal about letting a sound that’s unique to your body come out of your belly, susceptible to being heard by others — a bodily emission rendered as sound. Could such a thing ever be wanted? Even playing a cello (that lengthy embrace) is more detached. There’s an element of that embarrassing affect, enthusiasm, that’s necessarily present in singing.</description>

      <description>I saw the Chronicles Of Narnia movie this weekend. My biggest fear was that Disney would tinker with the story too much; this fear was unfounded. It’s a respectful and fairly faithful telling of the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Aslan is still not a tame lion, and is good, not safe, and Professor Kirke still wonders What do they teach at schools these days? I doubt that the movie will evoke much Sehnsucht.</description>

 The United States supported and in many cases engendered every right wing military dictatorship in the world after the end of the Second World War. I refer to Indonesia, Greece, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Haiti, Turkey, the Philippines, Guatemala, El Salvador, and, of course, Chile.
 He also describes the support for the Contras in Nicaragua.

      <description>Daughter Jane is taking an ATYP writing skills course, part of which is learning about the standard logical fallacies. Unfortunately, the website that hosted a good list of them, by Mike LaBossiere, has been down for a while. Fortunately, LaBossiere has allowed us to republish them, and so here it is: A Fallacy Recognition Handbook.</description>

      <title>Review: The Time Traveler’s Wife</title>

      <description>I attended a geek salon at halflab, and several of the attendees started discussing The Time Traveler’s Wife, Audrey Niffenegger’s first novel. Henry DeTamble has a problem: he has a genetic disorder that causes him to travel through time; unfortunately, he has little control over where and when, except he gravitates to significant points in his life, both past and future. What this does to his life, the life of his eventual wife (Clare Abshire), and their friends and family is handled intelligently and vividly, for the most part.</description>

      <description>From Samuel Butler’s The Book of the Machines in Erewhon:
 Complex now, but how much simpler and more intelligibly organised may [a machine] not become in another hundred thousand years? or in twenty thousand? For man at present believes that his interest lies in that direction; he spends an incalculable amount of labour and time and thought in making machines breed always better and better; he has already succeeded in effecting much that at one time appeared impossible, and there seem no limits to the results of accumulated improvements if they are allowed to descend with modification from generation to generation.</description>

      <description>I received an email from Justin Bur that says (quoting with permission):
 Your English version of Borges’ celebrated essay http://www.entish.org/essays/Wilkins.html contains a rather spectacular mistranslation based presumably on a typo in the original Spanish. Section 16 of Wilkins’ taxonomy classifies the *whale*, not beauty, as a viviparous oblong fish. There is a complete text online at http://reliant.teknowledge.com/Wilkins, and the relevant passage is on page 132. The confusion seems to arise from the graphic similarity between “ballena” (whale) and “belleza” (beauty) in Spanish.</description>

      <description>I was browsing Amazon’s list of best sellers in Christian fiction tonigh to see if books by a friend, Neta Jackson, were listed. They were! The Yada Yada Prayer Group is 96 today, and her upcoming The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Tough is at 24.
I was amused to see The Canterbury Tales listed at 38–that’s an impressive back list.</description>

      <description>Daughter Jane straightened out our DVDs today, at her mother’s request. She decided to organize by genre:
 Fighting movies (e.g. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), Animation (e.g. The Incredibles), Classicish (e.g. It’s a Wonderful Life), Magic (e.g., Harry Potter), Modern Action (e.g., Charlie’s Angels), Princess Movies (e.g. The Princess Diaries), Movies That I Have No Intention of Watching in the Next Millenium (e.g. 2001, A Space Oddesey).

      <description>Letters to the Editor – April 1973
 That Mr. Dahl’s books have a very powerful effect on children is evident. Kids between 8 and 11 seem to be truly fascinated by them; one of mine used to finish Charlie and then start it right over from the beginning (she was subject to these fits for about two months at age 11). She was like one possessed while reading it, and for a while after reading she was, for a usually amiable child, quite nasty.</description>

      <description>Daughter Jand and I have have finished the new Harry Potter book. I think it’s better written than the last book–tauter, more showing, less telling. Jane thought Rowling made several mistakes, including killing off a major character. It does get fairly dark near the end, as others have noted. This will be a harder book to film, I think. Rowling has a lot to do in the last book to bring out a reasonably happy ending.</description>

      <description>I grew up in Roseville, Michigan, an anonymous Detroit suburb of no distinction. It’s among the least beautiful places I’ve ever seen–the homes are non-descript, the businesses are strip-maill ugly. My father still lives there, so I visit it from time to time. One point of artistic light is a funky little studio run by Ed Stross, who has painted a large mural on the side of his building with portraits of Mother Theresa and Princess Diana.</description>

      <description>From the New York Times review of ‘The Complete Cartoons of the New Yorker’ by Walter Kern:
 [O]ne does sense that the cartoons have done the job they first set out to do: purging any lingering puritanism from their relatively well-heeled audience and replacing it with a smart-aleck self-awareness that suddenly — just look around — feels useless, lonely and crippling.
 I just received this book as a Christmas present.</description>

      <description>Geoff Pullum has a great anti-Struck and White rant, which he says is:
 a horrid little compendium of unmotivated prejudices (don’t use ongoing), arbitrary stipulations (don’t begin a sentence with however), and fatuous advice (“Be clear”), ridiculously out of date in its positions on appropriate choices among grammatical variants, deeply suspect in its style advice and grotesquely wrong in most of the grammatical advice it gives.
Struck and White was (I think) the first book on writing style I ever read, and I fell in love–mostly, I think, because of White’s introductory essay.</description>
