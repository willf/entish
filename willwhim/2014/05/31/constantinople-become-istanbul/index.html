<blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->“Istanbul” is still <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->less common<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> than “Constantinople” more than five hundred years after the the city fell to the Muslims.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
But I think this is either a bit tongue-in-cheek, or misinformed. Of course, the Ngram data records books discussing any period of history, and I suspect that more is written about historic Constantinople than modern Istanbul. Looking at Ngrams that are more time-sensitive show a different story, looking at “modern Istanbul/Constantinople” shows that the 1930’s was when the cross-over took place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also interesting to compare “churches in Istanbul/Constantinople” and “mosques in Istanbul/Constantinople.” Here’s a percentage chart of mosques in X/ mosques in X + churches in X:</p>
<p>The Ngrams don’t do so printing long comparisons, but you can see the difference easily enough.</p>
